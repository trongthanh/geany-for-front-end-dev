    <p>The Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.</p></desc>

    <category name="Event Object" slug="event-object">
      <desc>
        <p>jQuery's event system normalizes the event object according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/ecma-script-binding.html">W3C standards</a>. The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied over and normalized to the new event object.</p>
        <div class="longdesc">
          <h4>jQuery.Event Constructor</h4>
          <p>The <code>jQuery.Event</code> constructor is exposed and can be used when calling <a href="/trigger">trigger</a>. The <code>new</code> operator is optional.</p>
          <p>Check <a href="/trigger">trigger</a>'s documentation to see how to combine it with your own event object.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre><code>
//Create a new jQuery.Event object without the "new" operator.
var e = jQuery.Event( "click" );

// trigger an artificial click event
jQuery( "body" ).trigger( e );
</code></pre>
          <p>As of jQuery 1.6, you can also pass an object to <code>jQuery.Event()</code> and its properties will be set on the newly created Event object.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre><code>
// Create a new jQuery.Event object with specified event properties.
var e = jQuery.Event( "keydown", { keyCode: 64 } );

// trigger an artificial keydown event with keyCode 64
jQuery( "body" ).trigger( e );
</code></pre>
          <h4>Event Properties</h4>
          <p>jQuery normalizes the following properties for cross-browser consistency:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>target</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>relatedTarget</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>pageX</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>pageY</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>which</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>metaKey</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following properties are also copied to the event object, though some of their values may be undefined depending on the event:</p>
          <p>altKey, bubbles, button, cancelable, charCode, clientX, clientY, ctrlKey, currentTarget, data, detail, eventPhase, metaKey, offsetX, offsetY, originalTarget, pageX, pageY, prevValue, relatedTarget, screenX, screenY, shiftKey, target, view, which</p>
          <h4>OtherProperties</h4>
          <p>Certain events may have properties specific to them. Those can be accessed as properties of the <code>event.originalEvent</code> object.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <pre><code>
// add the dataTransfer property for use with the native `drop` event
// to capture information about files dropped into the browser window
jQuery.event.props.push( "dataTransfer" );

Still others modify entire elements (or groups of elements) themselves&#x2014;inserting, copying, removing, and so on. All of these methods are referred to as "setters," as they change the values of properties.
			A few of these methods&#x2014;such as <code>.attr()</code>, <code>.html()</code>, and <code>.val()</code>&#x2014;also act as "getters," retrieving information from DOM elements for later use.

    <desc>
      <p>Borrowing from CSS 1&#x2013;3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document.</p>
      <p>To use any of the meta-characters ( such as <code> !"#$%&amp;'()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^`{|}~</code> ) as a literal part of a name, it must be escaped with with two backslashes: <code>\\</code>. For example, an element with <code>id="foo.bar"</code>, can use the selector <code>$("#foo\\.bar")</code>. The W3C CSS specification contains the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier">complete set of rules regarding valid CSS selectors</a>. Also useful is the blog entry by Mathias Bynens on <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes">CSS character escape sequences for identifiers</a>.</p>
    </desc>
    <category name="Attribute" slug="attribute-selectors">
      <desc>
        <p>The CSS specification allows elements to be identified by their attributes. While not supported by some older browsers for the purpose of styling documents, jQuery allows you to employ them regardless of the browser being used.</p>
        <p>When using any of the following attribute selectors, you should account for attributes that have multiple, space-separated values. Since these selectors see attribute values as a single string, this selector, for example, <code>$("a[rel='nofollow']")</code>, will select <code>&lt;a href="example.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Some text&lt;/a&gt;</code> but not <code>&lt;a href="example.html" rel="nofollow foe"&gt;Some text&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Attribute values in selector expressions <b>must</b> follow the rules for W3C CSS selectors; in general, that means anything other than a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier">valid identifier</a> should be surrounded by quotation marks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>double quotes inside single quotes: <code>$('a[rel="nofollow self"]')</code></li>
          <li>single quotes inside double quotes: <code>$("a[rel='nofollow self']")</code></li>
          <li>escaped single quotes inside single quotes: <code>$('a[rel=\'nofollow self\']')</code></li>
          <li>escaped double quotes inside double quotes: <code>$("a[rel=\"nofollow self\"]")</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The variation you choose is generally a matter of style or convenience.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In jQuery 1.3 <code>[@attr]</code> style selectors were removed (they were previously deprecated in jQuery 1.2). Simply remove the "@" symbol from your selectors in order to make them work again.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.add()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object from the union of those elements and the ones passed into the method. The argument to <code>.add()</code> can be pretty much anything that <code>$()</code> accepts, including a jQuery selector expression, references to DOM elements, or an HTML snippet.</p>
    <p>Do not assume that this method appends the elements to the existing collection in the order they are passed to the <code>.add()</code> method. When all elements are members of the same document, the resulting collection from <code>.add()</code> will be sorted in document order; that is, in order of each element's appearance in the document. If the collection consists of elements from different documents or ones not in any document, the sort order is undefined. To create a jQuery object with elements in a well-defined order and without sorting overhead, use the <code>$(array_of_DOM_elements)</code> signature.</p>
    <p>The updated set of elements can be used in a following (chained) method, or assigned to a variable for later use. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "p" ).add( "div" ).addClass( "widget" );
var pdiv = $( "p" ).add( "div" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The following will <em>not</em> save the added elements, because the <code>.add()</code> method creates a new set and leaves the original set in pdiv unchanged:</p>
    <pre><code>
var pdiv = $( "p" );
pdiv.add( "div" ); // WRONG, pdiv will not change
    </code></pre>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list and a paragraph following it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can select the list items and then the paragraph by using either a selector or a reference to the DOM element itself as the <code>.add()</code> method's argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).add( "p" ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Or:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).add( document.getElementsByTagName( "p" )[ 0 ] )
  .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background behind all four elements.
Using an HTML snippet as the <code>.add()</code> method's argument (as in the third version), we can create additional elements on the fly and add those elements to the matched set of elements. Let's say, for example, that we want to alter the background of the list items along with a newly created paragraph:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).add( "&lt;p id='new'&gt;new paragraph&lt;/p&gt;" )
  .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Although the new paragraph has been created and its background color changed, it still does not appear on the page. To place it on the page, we could add one of the insertion methods to the chain.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4 the results from .add() will always be returned in document order (rather than a simple concatenation).</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> To reverse the <code>.add()</code> you can use <a href="/not/"><code>.not( elements | selector )</code></a> to remove elements from the jQuery results, or <a href="/end/"><code>.end()</code></a> to return to the selection before you added.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Finds all divs and makes a border.  Then adds all paragraphs to the jQuery object to set their backgrounds yellow.</desc>
    <code>
$( "div" ).css( "border", "2px solid red" )
  .add( "p" )
  .css( "background", "yellow" );
</code>
    <css>
  div {
    width: 60px;

  <signature>
    <added>1.8</added>
    <argument name="selector" type="Selector" optional="true">
      <desc>A string containing a selector expression to match the current set of elements against.</desc>
    </argument>
  </signature>
  <desc>Add the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set, optionally filtered by a selector.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>As described in the discussion for <code><a href="/end/">.end()</a></code>, jQuery objects maintain an internal stack that keeps track of changes to the matched set of elements. When one of the DOM traversal methods is called, the new set of elements is pushed onto the stack. If the previous set of elements is desired as well, <code>.addBack()</code> can help.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="third-item"&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of the following code is a red background behind items 3, 4 and 5:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li.third-item" ).nextAll().addBack()
  .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>First, the initial selector locates item 3, initializing the stack with the set containing just this item. The call to <code>.nextAll()</code> then pushes the set of items 4 and 5 onto the stack. Finally, the <code>.addBack()</code> invocation merges these two sets together, creating a jQuery object that points to all three items in document order: <code>{[&lt;li.third-item&gt;,&lt;li&gt;,&lt;li&gt; ]}</code>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>The <code>.addBack()</code> method causes the previous set of DOM elements in the traversal stack to be added to the current set. In the first example, the top stack contains the set resulting from <code>.find("p")</code>. In the second example, <code>.addBack()</code> adds the previous set of elements on the stack — in this case <code>$("div.after-addback")</code> — to the current set, selecting both the div and its enclosed paragraphs.</desc>
    <code>
$( "div.left, div.right" ).find( "div, div &gt; p" ).addClass( "border" );

// First Example
$( "div.before-addback" ).find( "p" ).addClass( "background" );

// Second Example
$( "div.after-addback" ).find( "p" ).addBack().addClass( "background" );

    <p>It's important to note that this method does not replace a class. It simply adds the class, appending it to any which may already be assigned to the elements.</p>
    <p>More than one class may be added at a time, separated by a space, to the set of matched elements, like so:</p>
    <pre><code>

    <p>This method is often used with <code>.removeClass()</code> to switch elements' classes from one to another, like so:</p>

    <p>Here, the <code>myClass</code> and <code>noClass</code> classes are removed from all paragraphs, while <code>yourClass</code> is added.</p>

    <pre><code>
$( "ul li" ).addClass(function( index ) {

  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.after()</code> and <code><a href="/insertAfter/">.insertAfter()</a></code> methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax—specifically, in the placement of the content and target. With <code>.after()</code>, the selector expression preceding the method is the container after which the content is inserted. With <code>.insertAfter()</code>, on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted after the target container.</p>
    <p>Using the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>Content can be created and then inserted after several elements at once:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).after( "&lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Each inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element gets this new content:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>An element in the DOM can also be selected and inserted after another element:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".container" ).after( $( "h2" ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>If an element selected this way is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be moved rather than cloned:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Important</strong>: If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target except for the last one.</p>
    <h4 id="disconnected-dom-nodes">Inserting Disconnected DOM nodes</h4>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4, <code>.before()</code> and <code>.after()</code> will also work on disconnected DOM nodes. For example, given the following code:</p>
    <pre><code>$( "&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" ).after( "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" );</code></pre>
    <p>The result is a jQuery set containing a div and a paragraph, in that order. That set can be further manipulated, even before it is inserted in the document.</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" )
  .after( "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" )
  .addClass( "foo" )
  .filter( "p" )
    .attr( "id", "bar" )
    .html( "hello" )
  .end()
  .appendTo( "body" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This results in the following elements inserted just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="foo"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="foo" id="bar"&gt;hello&lt;/p&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="passing-a-function">Passing a Function</h4>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4, <code>.after()</code> supports passing a function that returns the elements to insert.</p>

    <p>This example inserts a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> after each paragraph, with each new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containing the class name(s) of its preceding paragraph.</p>
    <h4 id="additional-arguments">Additional Arguments</h4>
    <p>Similar to other content-adding methods such as <code><a href="/prepend/">.prepend()</a></code> and <code><a href="/before/">.before()</a></code>, <code>.after()</code> also supports passing in multiple arguments as input. Supported input includes DOM elements, jQuery objects, HTML strings, and arrays of DOM elements.</p>
    <p>For example, the following will insert two new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and an existing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> after the first paragraph:</p>
    <pre><code>
var $newdiv1 = $( "&lt;div id='object1'/&gt;" ),
  newdiv2 = document.createElement( "div" ),
  existingdiv1 = document.getElementById( "foo" );

$( "p" ).first().after( $newdiv1, [ newdiv2, existingdiv1 ] );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Since <code>.after()</code> can accept any number of additional arguments, the same result can be achieved by passing in the three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s as three separate arguments, like so: <code>$( "p" ).first().after( $newdiv1, newdiv2, existingdiv1 )</code>. The type and number of arguments will largely depend on the elements that are collected in the code.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Prior to jQuery 1.9, <code>.after()</code> would attempt to add or change nodes in the current jQuery set if the first node in the set was not connected to a document, and in those cases return a new jQuery set rather than the original set. The method might or might not have returned a new result depending on the number or connectedness of its arguments! As of jQuery 1.9, <code>.after()</code>, <code>.before()</code>, and <code>.replaceWith()</code> always return the original unmodified set. Attempting to use these methods on a node without a parent has no effect—that is, neither the set nor the nodes it contains are changed.
		</note>
  <note>
			By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — <a href="/jQuery/">jQuery()</a>, <a href="/append/">.append()</a>, <a href="/after/">.after()</a>, etc. — can potentially execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code (for example, <code>&lt;img onload=""&gt;</code>). Do not use these methods to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

    <pre><code>
$( "li.third-item" ).nextAll().andSelf()
  .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>First, the initial selector locates item 3, initializing the stack with the set containing just this item. The call to <code>.nextAll()</code> then pushes the set of items 4 and 5 onto the stack. Finally, the <code>.andSelf()</code> invocation merges these two sets together, creating a jQuery object that points to all three items in document order: <code>[ &lt;li.third-item&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;li&gt; ]</code>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>The <code>.andSelf()</code> method causes the previous set of DOM elements in the traversal stack to be added to the current set. In the first example, the top stack contains the set resulting from <code>.find("p")</code>. In the second example, <code>.andSelf()</code> adds the previous set of elements on the stack — in this case <code>$( "div.after-andself" )</code> — to the current set, selecting both the div and its enclosed paragraphs.</desc>
    <code>
$( "div.left, div.right" ).find( "div, div &gt; p" ).addClass( "border" );

  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.animate()</code> method allows us to create animation effects on any numeric CSS property. The only required parameter is a plain object of CSS properties. This object is similar to the one that can be sent to the <code>.css()</code> method, except that the range of properties is more restrictive.</p>
    <h4 id="animation-properties">Animation Properties and Values</h4>
    <p>All animated properties should be animated to a <em>single numeric value</em>, except as noted below; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality (For example, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, or <code>left</code> can be animated but <code>background-color</code> cannot be, unless the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color">jQuery.Color()</a> plugin is used). Property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified. The units <code>em</code> and <code>%</code> can be specified where applicable.</p>
    <p>In addition to style properties, some non-style properties such as <code>scrollTop</code> and <code>scrollLeft</code>, as well as custom properties, can be animated.</p>
    <p>Shorthand CSS properties (e.g. font, background, border) are not fully supported. For example, if you want to animate the rendered border width, at least a border style and border width other than "auto" must be set in advance. Or, if you want to animate font size, you would use <code>fontSize</code> or the CSS equivalent <code>'font-size'</code> rather than simply <code>'font'</code>. </p>
    <p>In addition to numeric values, each property can take the strings <code>'show'</code>, <code>'hide'</code>, and <code>'toggle'</code>. These shortcuts allow for custom hiding and showing animations that take into account the display type of the element. In order to use jQuery's built-in toggle state tracking, the <code>'toggle'</code> keyword must be consistently given as the value of the property being animated.</p>
    <p>Animated properties can also be relative. If a value is supplied with a leading <code>+=</code> or <code>-=</code> sequence of characters, then the target value is computed by adding or subtracting the given number from the current value of the property.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike shorthand animation methods such as <code>.slideDown()</code> and <code>.fadeIn()</code>, the <code>.animate()</code> method does <em>not</em> make hidden elements visible as part of the effect. For example, given <code>$( "someElement" ).hide().animate({height: "20px"}, 500)</code>, the animation will run, but <em>the element will remain hidden</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="duration">Duration</h4>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The default duration is <code>400</code> milliseconds. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively.</p>
    <h4 id="complete">Complete Function</h4>
    <p>If supplied, the <code>complete</code> callback function is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <h4 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h4>
    <p>To animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"
  style="position: relative; left: 10px;"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>To animate the opacity, left offset, and height of the image simultaneously:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).animate({
    opacity: 0.25,
    left: "+=50",
    height: "toggle"
  }, 5000, function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/animate-1.jpg" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>Note that the target value of the <code>height</code> property is <code>'toggle'</code>. Since the image was visible before, the animation shrinks the height to 0 to hide it. A second click then reverses this transition:
    </p>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/animate-2.jpg" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The <code>opacity</code> of the image is already at its target value, so this property is not animated by the second click. Since the target value for <code>left</code> is a relative value, the image moves even farther to the right during this second animation.</p>
    <p>Directional properties (<code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>) have no discernible effect on elements if their  <code>position</code> style property is <code>static</code>, which it is by default.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>The <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> project extends the <code>.animate()</code> method by allowing some non-numeric styles such as colors to be animated. The project also includes mechanisms for specifying animations through CSS classes rather than individual attributes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> if attempting to animate an element with a height or width of 0px, where contents of the element are visible due to overflow, jQuery may clip this overflow during animation. By fixing the dimensions of the original element being hidden however, it is possible to ensure that the animation runs smoothly. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=clearfix">clearfix</a> can be used to automatically fix the dimensions of your main element without the need to set this manually.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="step">Step Function</h4>
    <p>The second version of <code>.animate()</code> provides a <code>step</code> option — a callback function that is fired at each step of the animation. This function is useful for enabling custom animation types or altering the animation as it is occurring. It accepts two arguments (<code>now</code> and <code>fx</code>), and <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>now</code>: the numeric value of the property being animated at each step</li>
      <li><code>fx</code>: a reference to the <code>jQuery.fx</code> prototype object, which contains a number of properties such as <code>elem</code> for the animated element, <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> for the first and last value of the animated property, respectively, and <code>prop</code> for the property being animated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the <code>step</code> function is called for each animated property on each animated element. For example, given two list items, the <code>step</code> function fires four times at each step of the animation:  </p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).animate({
  opacity: .5,
  height: "50%"
}, {
  step: function( now, fx ) {
    var data = fx.elem.id + " " + fx.prop + ": " + now;
    $( "body" ).append( "&lt;div&gt;" + data + "&lt;/div&gt;" );
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="easing">Easing</h4>
    <p>The remaining parameter of <code>.animate()</code> is a string naming an easing function to use. An easing function specifies the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="per-property-easing">Per-property Easing</h4>
    <p>As of jQuery version 1.4, you can set per-property easing functions within a single <code>.animate()</code> call. In the first version of <code>.animate()</code>, each property can take an array as its value: The first member of the array is the CSS property and the second member is an easing function.  If a per-property easing function is not defined for a particular property, it uses the value of the <code>.animate()</code> method's optional easing argument. If the easing argument is not defined, the default <code>swing</code> function is used.</p>
    <p>For example, to simultaneously animate the width and height with the <code>swing</code> easing function and the opacity with the <code>linear</code> easing function:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).animate({
    width: [ "toggle", "swing" ],
    height: [ "toggle", "swing" ],
    opacity: "toggle"
  }, 5000, "linear", function() {
    $( this ).after( "&lt;div&gt;Animation complete.&lt;/div&gt;" );
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the second version of <code>.animate()</code>, the options object can include the <code>specialEasing</code> property, which is itself an object of CSS properties and their corresponding easing functions.  For example, to simultaneously animate the width using the <code>linear</code> easing function and the height using the <code>easeOutBounce</code> easing function:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).animate({
    width: "toggle",
    height: "toggle"
  }, {
    duration: 5000,
    specialEasing: {
      width: "linear",
      height: "easeOutBounce"
    },
    complete: function() {
      $( this ).after( "&lt;div&gt;Animation complete.&lt;/div&gt;" );
    }
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>As previously noted, a plugin is required for the <code>easeOutBounce</code> function.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.animate()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

  <desc>Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.append()</code> method inserts the  specified content as the last child of each element in the jQuery collection (To insert it as the <em>first</em> child, use <a href="/prepend/"><code>.prepend()</code></a>). </p>
    <p>The <code>.append()</code> and <code><a href="/appendTo/">.appendTo()</a></code> methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the placement of the content and target. With <code>.append()</code>, the selector expression preceding the method is the container into which the content is inserted. With <code>.appendTo()</code>, on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container.</p>
    <p>Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can create content and insert it into several elements at once:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).append( "&lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Each inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element gets this new content:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    Hello
    &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    Goodbye
    &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can also select an element on the page and insert it into another:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".container" ).append( $( "h2" ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>If an element selected this way is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be moved into the target (not cloned):</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Important</strong>: If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target except for the last one.</p>
    <h4 id="additional-arguments">Additional Arguments</h4>
    <p>Similar to other content-adding methods such as <code><a href="/prepend/">.prepend()</a></code> and <code><a href="/before/">.before()</a></code>, <code>.append()</code> also supports passing in multiple arguments as input. Supported input includes DOM elements, jQuery objects, HTML strings, and arrays of DOM elements.</p>
    <p>For example, the following will insert two new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and an existing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as the last three child nodes of the body:</p>
    <pre><code>
var $newdiv1 = $( "&lt;div id='object1'/&gt;" ),
  newdiv2 = document.createElement( "div" ),
  existingdiv1 = document.getElementById( "foo" );

$( "body" ).append( $newdiv1, [ newdiv2, existingdiv1 ] );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Since <code>.append()</code> can accept any number of additional arguments, the same result can be achieved by passing in the three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s as three separate arguments, like so: <code>$('body').append( $newdiv1, newdiv2, existingdiv1 )</code>. The type and number of arguments will largely depend on how you collect the elements in your code.</p>

    <longdesc>
      <p>The <code>.attr()</code> method gets the attribute value for only the <em>first</em> element in the matched set. To get the value for each element individually, use a looping construct such as jQuery's <code>.each()</code> or <code>.map()</code> method.</p>
      <p>Using jQuery's <code>.attr()</code> method to get the value of an element's attribute has two main benefits:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Convenience</strong>: It can be called directly on a jQuery object and chained to other jQuery methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-browser consistency</strong>: The values of some attributes are reported inconsistently across browsers, and even across versions of a single browser. The <code>.attr()</code> method reduces such inconsistencies.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Attribute values are strings with the exception of a few attributes such as value and tabindex.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Attempting to change the <code>type</code> attribute (or property) of an <code>input</code> element created via HTML or already in an HTML document will result in an error being thrown by Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8.</p>
      </div>
      <p>As of jQuery 1.6, the <code>.attr()</code> method returns <code>undefined</code> for attributes that have not been set. <strong>To retrieve and change DOM properties such as the <code>checked</code>, <code>selected</code>, or <code>disabled</code> state of form elements, use the <a href="/prop/">.prop()</a> method.</strong></p>

      <h4>Attributes vs. Properties</h4>
      <p>The difference between <em>attributes</em> and <em>properties</em> can be important in specific situations. <strong>Before jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code>.attr()</code> method sometimes took property values into account when retrieving some attributes, which could cause inconsistent behavior. <strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code>.prop()</code> method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while <code>.attr()</code> retrieves attributes.</p>
      <p>For example, <code>selectedIndex</code>, <code>tagName</code>, <code>nodeName</code>, <code>nodeType</code>, <code>ownerDocument</code>, <code>defaultChecked</code>, and <code>defaultSelected</code> should be retrieved and set with the <code><a href="/prop/">.prop()</a></code> method. Prior to jQuery 1.6, these properties were retrievable with the <code>.attr()</code> method, but this was not within the scope of <code>attr</code>. These do not have corresponding attributes and are only properties.</p>
      <p>Concerning boolean attributes, consider a DOM element defined by the HTML markup <code>&lt;input type="checkbox" checked="checked" /&gt;</code>, and assume it is in a JavaScript variable named <code>elem</code>:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>elem.checked</code>
          </th>
          <td><code>true</code> (Boolean) Will change with checkbox state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>$( elem ).prop( "checked" )</code>
          </th>
          <td><code>true</code> (Boolean) Will change with checkbox state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>elem.getAttribute( "checked" )</code>
          </th>
          <td><code>"checked"</code> (String) Initial state of the checkbox; does not change</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>$( elem ).attr( "checked" )</code>
            <em>(1.6)</em>
          </th>
          <td><code>"checked"</code> (String) Initial state of the checkbox; does not change</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>$( elem ).attr( "checked" )</code>
            <em>(1.6.1+)</em>
          </th>
          <td><code>"checked"</code> (String) Will change with checkbox state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>

            <em>(pre-1.6)</em>
          </th>
          <td><code>true</code> (Boolean) Changed with checkbox state</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br/>
      <p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.4">W3C forms specification</a>, the <code>checked</code> attribute is a <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.3.4.2">boolean attribute</a></em>, which means the corresponding property is <strong>true</strong> if the attribute is present at all—even if, for example, the attribute has no value or is set to empty string value or even "false". This is true of all boolean attributes.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the most important concept to remember about the <code>checked</code> attribute is that it does not correspond to the <code>checked</code> property. The attribute actually corresponds to the <code>defaultChecked</code> property and should be used only to set the <em>initial</em> value of the checkbox. The <code>checked</code> attribute value does not change with the state of the checkbox, while the <code>checked</code> property does. Therefore, the cross-browser-compatible way to determine if a checkbox is checked is to use the property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>if ( elem.checked )</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>if ( $( elem ).prop( "checked" ) )</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>if ( $( elem ).is( ":checked" ) )</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The same is true for other dynamic attributes, such as <code>selected</code> and <code>value</code>.</p>
    </longdesc>
    <note>
			In Internet Explorer prior to version 9, using <code><a href="/prop/">.prop()</a></code> to set a DOM element property to anything other than a simple primitive value (number, string, or boolean) can cause memory leaks if the property is not removed (using <a href="/removeProp/"><code>.removeProp()</code></a>) before the DOM element is removed from the document. To safely set values on DOM objects without memory leaks, use <a href="/data/"><code>.data()</code></a>.

      <p>The <code>.attr()</code> method is a convenient way to set the value of attributes—especially when setting multiple attributes or using values returned by a function. Consider the following image:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img id="greatphoto" src="brush-seller.jpg" alt="brush seller"&gt;</code></pre>
      <h4 id="setting-simple-attr">Setting a simple attribute</h4>
      <p>To change the <code>alt</code> attribute, simply pass the name of the attribute and its new value to the <code>.attr()</code> method:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#greatphoto" ).attr( "alt", "Beijing Brush Seller" );
      </code></pre>
      <p><em>Add</em> an attribute the same way:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#greatphoto" ).attr( "title", "Photo by Kelly Clark" );
      </code></pre>
      <h4 id="setting-several-attrs">Setting several attributes at once</h4>
      <p>To change the <code>alt</code> attribute and add the <code>title</code> attribute at the same time, pass both sets of names and values into the method at once using a plain JavaScript object. Each key-value pair in the object adds or modifies an attribute:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#greatphoto" ).attr({
  alt: "Beijing Brush Seller",
  title: "photo by Kelly Clark"
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>When setting multiple attributes, the quotes around attribute names are optional.</p>
      <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: When setting the 'class' attribute, you must always use quotes!</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: jQuery prohibits changing the <code>type</code> attribute on an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element and will throw an error in all browsers. This is because the <code>type</code> attribute cannot be changed in Internet Explorer.</p>

      <p>By using a function to set attributes, you can compute the value based on other properties of the element. For example, to concatenate a new value with an existing value:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#greatphoto" ).attr( "title", function( i, val ) {
  return val + " - photo by Kelly Clark";
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>This use of a function to compute attribute values can be particularly useful when modifying the attributes of multiple elements at once.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>If nothing is returned in the setter function (ie. <code>function(index, attr){})</code>, or if <code>undefined</code> is returned, the current value is not changed. This is useful for selectively setting values only when certain criteria are met.</p>

  <desc>Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.before()</code> and <code><a href="/insertBefore/">.insertBefore()</a></code> methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the placement of the content and target. With <code>.before()</code>, the selector expression preceding the method is the container before which the content is inserted. With <code>.insertBefore()</code>, on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted before the target container.</p>
    <p>Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can create content and insert it before several elements at once:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).before( "&lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Each inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element gets this new content:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can also select an element on the page and insert it before another:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".container" ).before( $( "h2" ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>If an element selected this way is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be moved before the target (not cloned):</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Important</strong>: If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target except for the last one.</p>
    <p>In jQuery 1.4, <code>.before()</code> and <code>.after()</code> will also work on disconnected DOM nodes:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "&lt;div&gt;" ).before( "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result is a jQuery set that contains a paragraph and a div (in that order).</p>
    <h4 id="additional-arguments">Additional Arguments</h4>
    <p>Similar to other content-adding methods such as <code><a href="/prepend/">.prepend()</a></code> and <code><a href="/after/">.after()</a></code>, <code>.before()</code> also supports passing in multiple arguments as input. Supported input includes DOM elements, jQuery objects, HTML strings, and arrays of DOM elements.</p>
    <p>For example, the following will insert two new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and an existing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> before the first paragraph:</p>
    <pre><code>
var newdiv1 = $( "&lt;div id='object1'/&gt;" ),
  newdiv2 = document.createElement( "div" ),
  existingdiv1 = document.getElementById( "foo" );

$( "p" ).first().before( newdiv1, [ newdiv2, existingdiv1 ] );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Since <code>.before()</code> can accept any number of additional arguments, the same result can be achieved by passing in the three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s as three separate arguments, like so: <code>$( "p" ).first().before( $newdiv1, newdiv2, existingdiv1 )</code>. The type and number of arguments will largely depend on how you collect the elements in your code.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Prior to jQuery 1.9, <code>.before()</code> would attempt to add or change nodes in the current jQuery set if the first node in the set was not connected to a document, and in those cases return a new jQuery set rather than the original set. The method might or might not have returned a new result depending on the number or connectedness of its arguments! As of jQuery 1.9, <code>.after()</code>, <code>.before()</code>, and <code>.replaceWith()</code> always return the original unmodified set. Attempting to use these methods on a node without a parent has no effect—that is, neither the set nor the nodes it contains are changed.
		</note>
  <note>
			By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — <a href="/jQuery/">jQuery()</a>, <a href="/append/">.append()</a>, <a href="/after/">.after()</a>, etc. — can potentially execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code (for example, <code>&lt;img onload=""&gt;</code>). Do not use these methods to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

  <desc>Attach a handler to an event for the elements.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.7, the <a href="/on/"><code>.on()</code></a> method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document. For earlier versions, the <code>.bind()</code> method is used for attaching an event handler directly to elements. Handlers are attached to the currently selected elements in the jQuery object, so those elements <em>must exist</em> at the point the call to <code>.bind()</code> occurs. For more flexible event binding, see the discussion of event delegation in <a href="/on/"><code>.on()</code></a> or <a href="/delegate/"><code>.delegate()</code></a>.</p>
    <p>Any string is legal for <code>eventType</code>; if the string is not the name of a native DOM event, then the handler is bound to a custom event. These events are never called by the browser, but may be triggered manually from other JavaScript code using <code>.trigger()</code> or <code>.triggerHandler()</code>.</p>
    <p>If the <code>eventType</code> string contains a period (<code>.</code>) character, then the event is namespaced. The period character separates the event from its namespace. For example, in the call <code>.bind( "click.name", handler )</code>, the string <code>click</code> is the event type, and the string <code>name</code> is the namespace. Namespacing allows us to unbind or trigger some events of a type without affecting others. See the discussion of <code>.unbind()</code> for more information.</p>
    <p>There are shorthand methods for some standard browser events such as <a href="/click/"><code>.click()</code></a> that can be used to attach or trigger event handlers. For a complete list of shorthand methods, see the <a href="/category/events/">events category</a>.</p>
    <p>When an event reaches an element, all handlers bound to that event type for the element are fired. If there are multiple handlers registered, they will always execute in the order in which they were bound. After all handlers have executed, the event continues along the normal event propagation path.</p>
    <p>A basic usage of <code>.bind()</code> is:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", function() {
  alert( "User clicked on 'foo.'" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code will cause the element with an ID of <code>foo</code> to respond to the <code>click</code> event. When a user clicks inside this element thereafter, the alert will be shown.</p>
    <h4 id="multiple-events">Multiple Events</h4>
    <p>Multiple event types can be bound at once by including each one separated by a space:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).bind( "mouseenter mouseleave", function() {
  $( this ).toggleClass( "entered" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>The effect of this on <code>&lt;div id="foo"&gt;</code> (when it does not initially have the "entered" class) is to add the "entered" class when the mouse enters the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and remove the class when the mouse leaves. </p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4 we can bind multiple event handlers simultaneously by passing an object of event type/handler pairs:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).bind({
  click: function() {
    // Do something on click
  },
  mouseenter: function() {
    // Do something on mouseenter
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="event-handlers">Event Handlers</h4>
    <p>The <code>handler</code> parameter takes a callback function, as shown above. Within the handler, the keyword <code>this</code> refers to the DOM element to which the handler is bound. To make use of the element in jQuery, it can be passed to the normal <code>$()</code> function. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", function() {
  alert( $( this ).text() );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code is executed, when the user clicks inside the element with an ID of <code>foo</code>, its text contents will be shown as an alert.
    </p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4.2 duplicate event handlers can be bound to an element instead of being discarded. This is useful when the event data feature is being used, or when other unique data resides in a closure around the event handler function.</p>
    <p>In jQuery 1.4.3 you can now pass in <code>false</code> in place of an event handler. This will bind an event handler equivalent to: <code>function(){ return false; }</code>. This function can be removed at a later time by calling: <code>.unbind( eventName, false )</code>.</p>
    <h4 id="event-object">
      <a href="/category/events/event-object/">The Event object</a>
    </h4>
    <p>The <code>handler</code> callback function can also take parameters. When the function is called, the event object will be passed to the first parameter.</p>
    <p>The event object is often unnecessary and the parameter omitted, as sufficient context is usually available when the handler is bound to know exactly what needs to be done when the handler is triggered. However, at times it becomes necessary to gather more information about the user's environment at the time the event was initiated. <a href="/category/events/event-object/">View the full Event Object</a>.</p>
    <p>Returning <code>false</code> from a handler is equivalent to calling both <code>.preventDefault()</code> and <code>.stopPropagation()</code> on the event object.</p>
    <p>Using the event object in a handler looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( document ).ready(function() {
  $( "#foo" ).bind( "click", function( event ) {
    alert( "The mouse cursor is at (" +
      event.pageX + ", " + event.pageY +
      ")" );
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Note the parameter added to the anonymous function. This code will cause a click on the element with ID <code>foo</code> to report the page coordinates of the mouse cursor at the time of the click.</p>
    <h4 id="passing-event-data">Passing Event Data</h4>
    <p>The optional <code>eventData</code> parameter is not commonly used. When provided, this argument allows us to pass additional information to the handler. One handy use of this parameter is to work around issues caused by closures. For example, suppose we have two event handlers that both refer to the same external variable:</p>
    <pre><code>
var message = "Spoon!";
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", function() {
  alert( message );
});
message = "Not in the face!";
$( "#bar" ).bind( "click", function() {
  alert( message );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Because the handlers are closures that both have <code>message</code> in their environment, both will display the message <samp>Not in the face!</samp> when triggered. The variable's value has changed. To sidestep this, we can pass the message in using <code>eventData</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
var message = "Spoon!";
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", {
  msg: message
}, function( event ) {
  alert( event.data.msg );
});
message = "Not in the face!";
$( "#bar" ).bind( "click", {
  msg: message
}, function( event ) {
  alert( event.data.msg );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This time the variable is not referred to directly within the handlers; instead, the variable is passed in <em>by value</em> through <code>eventData</code>, which fixes the value at the time the event is bound. The first handler will now display <samp>Spoon!</samp> while the second will alert <samp>Not in the face!</samp>
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Note that objects are passed to functions <em>by reference</em>, which further complicates this scenario.</p>
    </div>
    <p>If <code>eventData</code> is present, it is the second argument to the <code>.bind()</code> method; if no additional data needs to be sent to the handler, then the callback is passed as the second and final argument.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>See the <code>.trigger()</code> method reference for a way to pass data to a handler at the time the event happens rather than when the handler is bound.</p>
    </div>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4 we can no longer attach data (and thus, events) to object, embed, or applet elements because critical errors occur when attaching data to Java applets.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Although demonstrated in the next example, it is inadvisable to bind handlers to both the <code>click</code> and <code>dblclick</code> events for the same element. The sequence of events triggered varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two click events before the <code>dblclick</code> and others only one. Double-click sensitivity (maximum time between clicks that is detected as a double click) can vary by operating system and browser, and is often user-configurable.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "blur", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "blur" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>blur</code> event is sent to an element when it loses focus. Originally, this event was only applicable to form elements, such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. In recent browsers, the domain of the event has been extended to include all element types. An element can lose focus via keyboard commands, such as the Tab key, or by mouse clicks elsewhere on the page.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input id="target" type="text" value="Field 1"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" value="Field 2"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
The event handler can be bound to the first input field:
$( "#target" ).blur(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .blur() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now if the first field has the focus, clicking elsewhere or tabbing away from it displays the alert:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .blur() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>To trigger the event programmatically, apply <code>.blur()</code> without an argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).blur();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>The <code>blur</code> event does not bubble in Internet Explorer. Therefore, scripts that rely on event delegation with the <code>blur</code> event will not work consistently across browsers. As of version 1.4.2, however, jQuery works around this limitation by mapping <code>blur</code> to the <code>focusout</code> event in its event delegation methods, <a href="/live/"><code>.live()</code></a> and <a href="/delegate/"><code>.delegate()</code></a>.</p>

$( "p" ).blur();

			Because <code>:button</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:button</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method.

  <longdesc>
    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "change", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "change" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>change</code> event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> boxes and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements. For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input class="target" type="text" value="Field 1"&gt;
  &lt;select class="target"&gt;
    &lt;option value="option1" selected="selected"&gt;Option 1&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="option2"&gt;Option 2&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the text input and the select box:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".target" ).change(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .change() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the second option is selected from the dropdown, the alert is displayed. It is also displayed if you change the text in the field and then click away. If the field loses focus without the contents having changed, though, the event is not triggered. To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.change()</code> without arguments:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( ".target" ).change();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message. The message will display twice, because the handler has been bound to the <code>change</code> event on both of the form elements.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4, the <code>change</code> event bubbles in Internet Explorer, behaving consistently with the event in other modern browsers.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Attaches a change event to the select that gets the text for each selected option and writes them in the div.  It then triggers the event for the initial text draw.</desc>
    <code>
$( "select" )
  .change(function () {
    var str = "";
    $( "select option:selected" ).each(function() {
      str += $( this ).text() + " ";
    });
    $( "div" ).text( str );
  })
  .change();

  <longdesc>
    <p><code>$( ":checkbox" )</code> is equivalent to <code>$( "[type=checkbox]" )</code>. As with other pseudo-class selectors (those that begin with a ":") it is recommended to precede it with a tag name or some other selector; otherwise, the universal selector ("*") is implied. In other words, the bare <code>$(':checkbox')</code> is equivalent to <code>$( "*:checkbox" )</code>, so <code>$( "input:checkbox" )</code> should be used instead. </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:checkbox</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:checkbox</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. For better performance in modern browsers, use <code>[type="checkbox"]</code> instead.

      <desc>A string containing a selector expression to match elements against.</desc>

  </signature>
  <desc>Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.children()</code> method allows us to search through the children of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements. The <code>.children()</code> method differs from <code><a href="/find/">.find()</a></code> in that <code>.children()</code> only travels a single level down the DOM tree while <code>.find()</code> can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well. Note also that like most jQuery methods, <code>.children()</code> does not return text nodes; to get <em>all</em> children including text and comment nodes, use <code><a href="/contents/">.contents()</a></code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>.children()</code> method optionally accepts a selector expression of the same type that we can pass to the <code>$()</code> function. If the selector is supplied, the elements will be filtered by testing whether they match it.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a basic nested list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="level-1"&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-i"&gt;I&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-ii"&gt;II
    &lt;ul class="level-2"&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-a"&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-b"&gt;B
        &lt;ul class="level-3"&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-1"&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-2"&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-3"&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-c"&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-iii"&gt;III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>If we begin at the level-2 list, we can find its children:</p>
    <pre><code>$( "ul.level-2" ).children().css( "background-color", "red" );</code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background behind items A, B, and C. Since we do not supply a selector expression, all of the children are part of the returned jQuery object. If we had supplied one, only the matching items among these three would be included.</p>

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "click", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "click" )</code> in the third.
    The <code>click</code> event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is pressed and released. Any HTML element can receive this event.
    For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="target"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/0042_05_03.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).click(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .click() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now if we click on this element, the alert is displayed:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .click() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>We can also trigger the event when a different element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).click();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicking on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>The <code>click</code> event is only triggered after this exact series of events:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The mouse button is depressed while the pointer is inside the element.</li>
      <li>The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is usually the desired sequence before taking an action. If this is not required, the <code>mousedown</code> or <code>mouseup</code> event may be more suitable.</p>

  <desc>Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.clone()</code> method performs a <em>deep</em> copy of the set of matched elements, meaning that it copies the matched elements as well as all of their descendant elements and text nodes.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> For performance reasons, the dynamic state of certain form elements (e.g., user data typed into <code>textarea</code> and user selections made to a <code>select</code>) is not copied to the cloned elements. When cloning <code>input</code> elements, the dynamic state of the element (e.g., user data typed into text inputs and user selections made to a checkbox) is retained in the cloned elements.</p>
    </div>
    <p>When used in conjunction with one of the insertion methods, <code>.clone()</code> is a convenient way to duplicate elements on a page. Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>As shown in the discussion for <code><a href="/append/">.append()</a></code>,  normally when an element is inserted somewhere in the DOM, it is moved from its old location. So, given the code:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".hello" ).appendTo( ".goodbye" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The resulting DOM structure would be:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;
    Goodbye
    &lt;div class="hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>To prevent this and instead create a copy of the element, you could write the following:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".hello" ).clone().appendTo( ".goodbye" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This would produce:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;
    Goodbye
    &lt;div class="hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using the <code>.clone()</code> method, you can modify the cloned elements or their contents before (re-)inserting them into the document.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Normally, any event handlers bound to the original element are <em>not</em> copied to the clone. The optional <code>withDataAndEvents</code> parameter allows us to change this behavior, and to instead make copies of all of the event handlers as well, bound to the new copy of the element. As of jQuery 1.4, all element data (attached by the <code>.data()</code> method) is also copied to the new copy. </p>
    <p>However, objects and arrays within element data are not copied and will continue to be shared between the cloned element and the original element. To deep copy all data, copy each one manually:</p>
    <pre><code>
// Original element with attached data
var $elem = $( "#elem" ).data( "arr": [ 1 ] ),
    $clone = $elem.clone( true )
      // Deep copy to prevent data sharing
      .data( "arr", $.extend( [], $elem.data( "arr" ) ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.5, <code>withDataAndEvents</code> can be optionally enhanced with <code>deepWithDataAndEvents </code> to copy the events and data for all children of the cloned element.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>.clone()</code> has the side-effect of producing elements with duplicate <code>id</code> attributes, which are supposed to be unique. Where possible, it is recommended to avoid cloning elements with this attribute or using <code>class</code> attributes as identifiers instead.</p>

    <p>We can employ the <code>.contents()</code> method to help convert this blob of text into three well-formed paragraphs:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".container" )
  .contents()
    .filter(function() {
      return this.nodeType === 3;
    })
      .wrap( "&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" )
      .end()
    .filter( "br" )
    .remove();
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code first retrieves the contents  of <code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;</code> and then filters it for text nodes, which are wrapped in paragraph tags. This is accomplished by testing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nodeType"><code>.nodeType</code> property</a> of the element. This DOM property holds a numeric code indicating the node's type; text nodes use the code 3. The contents are again filtered, this time for <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> elements, and these elements are removed.</p>

    <desc>Get the computed style properties for the first element in the set of matched elements.</desc>
    <longdesc>
      <p>The <code>.css()</code> method is a convenient way to get a style property from the first matched element, especially in light of the different ways browsers access most of those properties (the <code>getComputedStyle()</code> method in standards-based browsers versus the <code>currentStyle</code> and <code>runtimeStyle</code> properties in Internet Explorer) and the different terms browsers use for certain properties. For example, Internet Explorer's DOM implementation refers to the <code>float</code> property as <code>styleFloat</code>, while W3C standards-compliant browsers refer to it as <code>cssFloat</code>. For consistency, you can simply use <code>"float"</code>, and jQuery will translate it to the correct value for each browser.</p>
      <p>Also, jQuery can equally interpret the CSS and DOM formatting of multiple-word properties. For example, jQuery understands and returns the correct value for both <code>.css( "background-color" )</code> and <code>.css( "backgroundColor" )</code>.</p>
	  <p>Note that the <em>computed style</em> of an element may not be the same as the value specified for that element in a style sheet. For example, computed styles of dimensions are almost always pixels, but they can be specified as em, ex, px or % in a style sheet. Different browsers may return CSS color values that are logically but not textually equal, e.g., #FFF, #ffffff, and rgb(255,255,255).</p>
      <p>Retrieval of shorthand CSS properties (e.g., <code>margin</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>border</code>), although functional with some browsers, is not guaranteed. For example, if you want to retrieve the rendered <code>border-width</code>, use: <code>$( elem ).css( "borderTopWidth" )</code>, <code>$( elem ).css( "borderBottomWidth" )</code>, and so on.</p>
      <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.9</strong>, passing an array of style properties to <code>.css()</code> will result in an object of property-value pairs. For example, to retrieve all four rendered <code>border-width</code> values, you could use <code>$( elem ).css([ "borderTopWidth", "borderRightWidth", "borderBottomWidth", "borderLeftWidth" ])</code>. </p>

    <longdesc>
      <p>As with the <code>.prop()</code> method, the <code>.css()</code> method makes setting properties of elements quick and easy. This method can take either a property name and value as separate parameters, or a single object of key-value pairs.</p>
      <p>Also, jQuery can equally interpret the CSS and DOM formatting of multiple-word properties. For example, jQuery understands and returns the correct value for both <code>.css({ "background-color": "#ffe", "border-left": "5px solid #ccc" })</code> and <code>.css({backgroundColor: "#ffe", borderLeft: "5px solid #ccc" })</code>. Notice that with the DOM notation, quotation marks around the property names are optional, but with CSS notation they're required due to the hyphen in the name.</p>
      <p>When using <code>.css()</code> as a setter, jQuery modifies the element's <code>style</code> property. For example,  <code>$( "#mydiv" ).css( "color", "green" )</code> is equivalent to <code>document.getElementById( "mydiv" ).style.color = "green"</code>. Setting the value of a style property to an empty string — e.g. <code>$( "#mydiv" ).css( "color", "" )</code> — removes that property from an element if it has already been directly applied, whether in the HTML style attribute, through jQuery's <code>.css()</code> method, or through direct DOM manipulation of the <code>style</code> property. It does not, however, remove a style that has been applied with a CSS rule in a stylesheet or <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element. <strong>Warning:</strong> one notable exception is that, for IE 8 and below, removing a shorthand property such as <code>border</code> or <code>background</code> will remove that style entirely from the element, regardless of what is set in a stylesheet or <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element.</p>
      <p>As of jQuery 1.6, <code>.css()</code> accepts relative values similar to <code>.animate()</code>. Relative values are a string starting with <code>+=</code> or <code>-=</code> to increment or decrement the current value. For example, if an element's padding-left was 10px, <code>.css( "padding-left", "+=15" )</code> would result in a total padding-left of 25px.</p>
      <p>As of jQuery 1.4, <code>.css()</code> allows us to pass a function as the property value:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div.example" ).css( "width", function( index ) {
  return index * 50;
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>This example sets the widths of the matched elements to incrementally larger values.</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>If nothing is returned in the setter function (ie. <code>function( index, style ){} )</code>, or if <code>undefined</code> is returned, the current value is not changed. This is useful for selectively setting values only when certain criteria are met.</p>

      <p>In jQuery 1.4.3 setting an element's data object with <code>.data(obj)</code> extends the data previously stored with that element. jQuery itself uses the <code>.data()</code> method to save information under the names 'events' and 'handle', and also reserves any data name starting with an underscore ('_') for internal use.</p>
      <p>Prior to jQuery 1.4.3 (starting in jQuery 1.4) the <code>.data()</code> method completely replaced all data, instead of just extending the data object. If you are using third-party plugins it may not be advisable to completely replace the element's data object, since plugins may have also set data.</p>
      <p>Due to the way browsers interact with plugins and external code, the <code>.data()</code> method cannot be used on <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> (unless it's a Flash plugin), <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> elements.</p>

      <p>As of jQuery 1.4.3 <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/">HTML 5 data- attributes</a> will be automatically pulled in to jQuery's data object. The treatment of attributes with embedded dashes was changed in jQuery 1.6 to conform to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-*-attributes">W3C HTML5 specification</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, given the following HTML:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;div data-role="page" data-last-value="43" data-hidden="true" data-options='{"name":"John"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>All of the following jQuery code will work.</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div" ).data( "role" ) === "page";
$( "div" ).data( "lastValue" ) === 43;
$( "div" ).data( "hidden" ) === true;
$( "div" ).data( "options" ).name === "John";
      </code></pre>
      <p>Every attempt is made to convert the string to a JavaScript value (this includes booleans, numbers, objects, arrays, and null). A value is only converted to a number if doing so doesn't change the value's representation. For example, "1E02" and "100.000" are equivalent as numbers (numeric value 100) but converting them would alter their representation so they are left as strings. The string value "100" is converted to the number 100.</p>
	  <p>When the data attribute is an object (starts with '{') or array (starts with '[') then <code>jQuery.parseJSON</code> is used to parse the string; it must follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example">valid JSON syntax</a> <em>including quoted property names</em>. If the value isn't parseable as a JavaScript value, it is left as a string.</p>
	  <p>To retrieve the value's attribute as a string without any attempt to convert it, use the <code><a href="/attr/">attr()</a></code> method.</p>
	  <p>The data- attributes are pulled in the first time the data property is accessed and then are no longer accessed or mutated (all data values are then stored internally in jQuery).</p>
      <p>Calling <code>.data()</code> with no parameters retrieves all of the values as a JavaScript object. This object can be safely cached in a variable as long as a new object is not set with <code>.data(obj)</code>. Using the object directly to get or set values is faster than making individual calls to <code>.data()</code> to get or set each value:</p>
      <pre><code>
var mydata = $( "#mydiv" ).data();
if ( mydata.count &lt; 9 ) {
  mydata.count = 43;
  mydata.status = "embiggened";

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "dblclick", handler)</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "dblclick" )</code> in the third.
    The <code>dblclick</code> event is sent to an element when the element is double-clicked. Any HTML element can receive this event.
    For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="target"&gt;
  Double-click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/0042_05_04.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).dblclick(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .dblclick() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now double-clicking on this element displays the alert:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .dblclick() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.dblclick()</code> without an argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).dblclick();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, (single) clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>The <code>dblclick</code> event is only triggered after this exact series of events:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The mouse button is depressed while the pointer is inside the element.</li>
      <li>The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.</li>
      <li>The mouse button is depressed again while the pointer is inside the element, within a time window that is system-dependent.</li>
      <li>The mouse button is released while the pointer is inside the element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is inadvisable to bind handlers to both the <code>click</code> and <code>dblclick</code> events for the same element. The sequence of events triggered varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two <code>click</code> events before the <code>dblclick</code> and others only one. Double-click sensitivity (maximum time between clicks that is detected as a double click) can vary by operating system and browser, and is often user-configurable.
    </p>

  <example>
    <desc>To bind a "Hello World!" alert box the dblclick event on every paragraph on the page:</desc>
    <code>
$( "p" ).dblclick(function() {
  alert( "Hello World!" );
});

    <p>The <code>deferred.pipe()</code> method returns a new promise that filters the status and values of a deferred through a function.  The <code>doneFilter</code> and <code>failFilter</code> functions filter the original deferred's resolved / rejected status and values. <strong>As of jQuery 1.7</strong>, the method also accepts a <code>progressFilter</code> function to filter any calls to the original deferred's <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyWith</code> methods. These filter functions can return a new value to be passed along to the piped promise's <code>done()</code> or <code>fail()</code> callbacks, or they can return another observable object (Deferred, Promise, etc) which will pass its resolved / rejected status and values to the piped promise's callbacks. If the filter function used is <code>null</code>, or not specified, the piped promise will be resolved or rejected with the same values as the original.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>deferred.promise()</code> method allows an asynchronous function to prevent other code from interfering with the progress or status of its internal request. The Promise exposes only the Deferred methods needed to attach additional handlers or determine the state (<code>then</code>, <code>done</code>, <code>fail</code>, <code>always</code>, <code>pipe</code>, <code>progress</code>, and <code>state</code>), but not ones that change the state (<code>resolve</code>, <code>reject</code>, <code>notify</code>, <code>resolveWith</code>, <code>rejectWith</code>, and <code>notifyWith</code>).</p>
    <p>If <code>target</code> is provided, <code>deferred.promise()</code> will attach the methods onto it and then return this object rather than create a new one. This can be useful to attach the Promise behavior to an object that already exists.</p>
    <p>If you are creating a Deferred, keep a reference to the Deferred so that it can be resolved or rejected at some point. Return <em>only</em> the Promise object via <code>deferred.promise()</code> so other code can register callbacks or inspect the current state.</p>

  <desc>Determine the current state of a Deferred object. </desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The deferred.state() method returns a string representing the current state of the Deferred object. The Deferred object can be in one of three states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"pending"</strong>: The Deferred object is not yet in a completed state (neither "rejected" nor "resolved").</li>
      <li><strong>"resolved"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <a href="/deferred.resolve/"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.resolveWith/"><code>deferred.resolveWith()</code></a> has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called). </li>
      <li><strong>"rejected"</strong>: The Deferred object is in the rejected state, meaning that either <a href="/deferred.reject/"><code>deferred.reject()</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.rejectWith/"><code>deferred.rejectWith()</code></a> has been called for the object and the failCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This method is primarily useful for debugging to determine, for example, whether a Deferred has already been resolved even though you are inside code that intended to reject it.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p><strong>Prior to jQuery 1.8</strong>, the arguments could be a function or an array of functions.</p>
    <p>For all signatures, the arguments can be <code>null</code> if no callback of that type is desired. Alternatively, use <code>.done()</code>, <code>.fail()</code> or <code>.progress()</code> to set only one type of callback without filtering status or values. </p>

    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.8</strong>, the <code>deferred.then()</code> method returns a new promise that can filter the status and values of a deferred through a function, replacing the now-deprecated <code>deferred.pipe()</code> method. The <code>doneFilter</code> and <code>failFilter</code> functions filter the original deferred's resolved / rejected status and values. The <code>progressFilter</code> function filters any calls to the original deferred's <code>notify</code> or <code>notifyWith</code> methods. These filter functions can return a new value to be passed along to the promise's <code>.done()</code> or <code>.fail()</code> callbacks, or they can return another observable object (Deferred, Promise, etc) which will pass its resolved / rejected status and values to the promise's callbacks. If the filter function used is <code>null</code>, or not specified, the promise will be resolved or rejected with the same values as the original.</p>

    <p>Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Since
      <code>deferred.then</code> returns a Promise, other methods of the
      Promise object can be chained to this one, including additional
      <code>.then()</code> methods.
    </p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Since the <a href="/jQuery.get/"><code>jQuery.get</code></a> method returns a jqXHR object, which is derived from a Deferred object, we can attach handlers using the <code>.then</code> method.</desc>

  <desc>Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Added to jQuery in version 1.4, the <code>.delay()</code> method allows us to delay the execution of functions that follow it in the queue. It can be used with the standard effects queue or with a custom queue. Only subsequent events in a queue are delayed; for example this will <em>not</em> delay the no-arguments forms of <code>.show()</code> or <code>.hide()</code>  which do not use the effects queue.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, respectively.</p>
    <p>Using the standard effects queue, we can, for example, set an 800-millisecond delay between the <code>.slideUp()</code> and <code>.fadeIn()</code> of <code>&lt;div id="foo"&gt;</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).slideUp( 300 ).delay( 800 ).fadeIn( 400 );
    </code></pre>
    <p>When this statement is executed, the element slides up for 300 milliseconds and then pauses for 800 milliseconds before fading in for 400 milliseconds.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>
        <strong>The <code>.delay()</code> method is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects. Because it is limited—it doesn't, for example, offer a way to cancel the delay—<code>.delay()</code> is not a replacement for JavaScript's native <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout">setTimeout</a> function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases.</strong>

    <p>As of jQuery 1.7, <code>.delegate()</code> has been superseded by the <a href="/on/">.on()</a> method. For earlier versions, however, it remains the most effective means to use event delegation. More information on event binding and delegation is in the <a href="/on/">.on()</a> method. In general, these are the equivalent templates for the two methods:</p>
    <pre><code>
// jQuery 1.4.3+
$( elements ).delegate( selector, events, data, handler );
// jQuery 1.7+
$( elements ).on( events, selector, data, handler );
    </code></pre>
    <p>For example, the following <code>.delegate()</code> code:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "table" ).delegate( "td", "click", function() {
  $( this ).toggleClass( "chosen" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>is equivalent to the following code written using <code>.on()</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "table" ).on( "click", "td", function() {
  $( this ).toggleClass( "chosen" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>To remove events attached with <code>delegate()</code>, see  the <a href="/undelegate/">.undelegate()</a> method.</p>
    <p>Passing and handling event data works the same way as it does for <code>.on()</code>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Since the <a href="/live/"><code>.live()</code></a> method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events. Similarly, events handled by <code><a href="/delegate/">.delegate()</a></code> will propagate to the elements to which they are delegated; event handlers bound on any elements below it in the DOM tree will already have been executed by the time the delegated event handler is called. These handlers, therefore, may prevent the delegated handler from triggering by calling <code><a href="/event.stopPropagation/">event.stopPropagation()</a></code> or returning <code>false</code>.

  <desc>Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. </desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.each()</code> method is designed to make DOM looping constructs concise and less error-prone. When called it iterates over the DOM elements that are part of the jQuery object. Each time the callback runs, it is passed the current loop iteration, beginning from 0. More importantly, the callback is fired in the context of the current DOM element, so the keyword <code>this</code> refers to the element.</p>
    <p>Suppose you have a simple unordered list on the page:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can select the list items and iterate across them:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).each(function( index ) {
  console.log( index + ": " + $( this ).text() );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>A message is thus logged for each item in the list:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>0: foo</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>1: bar</samp>
    </p>
    <p>You can stop the loop from within the callback function by returning <code>false</code>.</p>
    <p>Note: most jQuery methods that return a jQuery object also loop through the set of elements in the jQuery collection — a process known as <i>implicit iteration</i>. When this occurs, it is often unnecessary to <i>explicitly</i> iterate with the <code>.each()</code> method:</p>
    <pre><code>
// The .each() method is unnecessary here:
$( "li" ).each(function() {
  $( this ).addClass( "foo" );
});

// Instead, you should rely on implicit iteration:
$( "li" ).addClass( "bar" );
    </code></pre>

    <desc>Iterate over three divs and sets their color property.</desc>

  <desc>Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>This method removes not only child (and other descendant) elements, but also any text within the set of matched elements. This is because, according to the DOM specification, any string of text within an element is considered a child node of that element. Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can target any element for removal:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".hello" ).empty();
    </code></pre>
    <p>This will result in a DOM structure with the <code>Hello</code> text deleted:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="hello"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we had any number of nested elements inside <code>&lt;div class="hello"&gt;</code>, they would be removed, too.</p>
    <p>To avoid memory leaks, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers from the child elements before removing the elements themselves.</p>
    <p>If you want to remove elements without destroying their data or event handlers (so they can be re-added later), use <a href="/detach/"><code>.detach()</code></a> instead.</p>

  <desc>End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Most of jQuery's <a href="/category/traversing/">DOM traversal</a> methods operate on a jQuery object instance and produce a new one, matching a different set of DOM elements. When this happens, it is as if the new set of elements is pushed onto a stack that is maintained inside the object. Each successive filtering method pushes a new element set onto the stack. If we need an older element set, we can use <code>end()</code> to pop the sets back off of the stack.</p>
    <p>Suppose we have a couple short lists on a page:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="first"&gt;
  &lt;li class="foo"&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="bar"&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="second"&gt;
  &lt;li class="foo"&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="bar"&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>end()</code> method is useful primarily when exploiting jQuery's chaining properties. When not using chaining, we can usually just call up a previous object by variable name, so we don't need to manipulate the stack. With <code>end()</code>, though, we can string all the method calls together:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "ul.first" )
  .find( ".foo" )
    .css( "background-color", "red" )
  .end()
  .find( ".bar" )
    .css( "background-color", "green" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This chain searches for items with the class <code>foo</code> within the first list only and turns their backgrounds red. Then <code>end()</code> returns the object to its state before the call to <code>find()</code>, so the second <code>find()</code> looks for '.bar' inside <code>&lt;ul class="first"&gt;</code>, not just inside that list's <code>&lt;li class="foo"&gt;</code>, and turns the matching elements' backgrounds green. The net result is that items 1 and 3 of the first list have a colored background, and none of the items from the second list do.</p>
    <p>A long jQuery chain can be visualized as a structured code block, with filtering methods providing the openings of nested blocks and <code>end()</code> methods closing them:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "ul.first" )
  .find( ".foo" )
    .css( "background-color", "red" )
  .end()
  .find( ".bar" )
    .css( "background-color", "green" )
  .end();
    </code></pre>
    <p>The last <code>end()</code> is unnecessary, as we are discarding the jQuery object immediately thereafter. However, when the code is written in this form, the <code>end()</code> provides visual symmetry and a sense of completion —making the program, at least to the eyes of some developers, more readable, at the cost of a slight hit to performance as it is an additional function call.</p>

    <p>The index-related selectors (<code>:eq()</code>, <code>:lt()</code>, <code>:gt()</code>, <code>:even</code>, <code>:odd</code>) filter the set of elements that have matched the expressions that precede them. They narrow the set down based on the order of the elements within this matched set. For example, if elements are first selected with a class selector (<code>.myclass</code>) and four elements are returned, these elements are given indices <code>0</code> through <code>3</code> for the purposes of these selectors.</p>
    <p>Note that since JavaScript arrays use <em>0-based indexing</em>, these selectors reflect that fact. This is why <code>$( ".myclass:eq(1)" )</code> selects the second element in the document with the class myclass, rather than the first. In contrast, <code>:nth-child(n)</code> uses <em>1-based indexing</em> to conform to the CSS specification.</p>
    <p>Prior to jQuery 1.8, the <code>:eq(index)</code> selector did <em>not</em> accept a negative value for <code>index</code> (though the <a href="/eq/"><code>.eq(index)</code></a> method did).</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:eq()</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:eq()</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. For better performance in modern browsers, use <code>$("your-pure-css-selector").eq(index)</code> instead.

  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.eq()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object from one element within that set. The supplied index identifies the position of this element in the set. </p>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can apply this method to the set of list items:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).eq( 2 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background for item 3. Note that the supplied index is zero-based, and refers to the position of the element within the jQuery object, not within the DOM tree.</p>
    <p>Providing a negative number indicates a position starting from the end of the set, rather than the beginning. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).eq( -2 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This time list item 4 is turned red, since it is two from the end of the set.</p>
    <p>If an element cannot be found at the specified zero-based index, the method constructs a new jQuery object with an empty set and a <code>length</code> property of 0. </p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).eq( 5 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Here, none of the list items is turned red, since <code>.eq( 5 )</code> indicates the sixth of five list items.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Turn the div with index 2 blue by adding an appropriate class.</desc>
    <code>

  </signature>
  <longdesc>
    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "error", handler )</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>error</code> event is sent to elements, such as images, that are referenced by a document and loaded by the browser. It is called if the element was not loaded correctly.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a page with a simple image element:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;img alt="Book" id="book"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the image:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#book" )
  .error(function() {
    alert( "Handler for .error() called." )
  })
  .attr( "src", "missing.png" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>If the image cannot be loaded (for example, because it is not present at the supplied URL), the alert  is displayed:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .error() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>The event handler <em>must</em> be attached before the browser fires the error event, which is why the example sets the src attribute after attaching the handler. Also, the error event may not be correctly fired when the page is served locally; <code>error</code> relies on HTTP status codes and will generally not be triggered if the URL uses the <code>file:</code> protocol.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Note: A jQuery error event handler should not be attached to the window object. The browser fires the window's error event when a script error occurs. However, the window error event receives different arguments and has different return value requirements than conventional event handlers. Use <code>window.onerror</code> instead.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>To hide the "broken image" icons for IE users, you can try:</desc>
    <code>
$( "img" )
  .error(function() {
    $( this ).hide();
  })
  .attr( "src", "missing.png" );

			Since the <a href="/live/"><code>.live()</code></a> method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events.

    <p>The <code>.fadeIn()</code> method animates the opacity of the matched elements. It is similar to the <code><a href="/fadeTo/">.fadeTo()</a></code> method but that method does not unhide the element and can specify the final opacity level.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied, or if the <code>duration</code> parameter is omitted, the default duration of  <code>400</code> milliseconds is used.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;

// With the element initially hidden, we can show it slowly:
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).fadeIn( "slow", function() {
    // Animation complete
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image four-across">
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_33.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_34.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_35.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_36.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <h4 id="easing">Easing</h4>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4.3</strong>, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="callback-function">Callback Function</h4>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole. </p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code><a href="/promise/">.promise()</a></code> method can be used in conjunction with the <code><a href="/deferred.done/">deferred.done()</a></code> method to execute a single callback for the animation as a whole when <em>all</em> matching elements have completed their animations ( See the <a href="/promise/#example-1">example for .promise()</a> ).  </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.fadeIn()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

    <p>The <code>.fadeOut()</code> method animates the opacity of the matched elements. Once the opacity reaches 0, the <code>display</code> style property is set to <code>none</code>, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied, or if the <code>duration</code> parameter is omitted, the default duration of  <code>400</code> milliseconds is used.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>With the element initially shown, we can hide it slowly:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).fadeOut( "slow", function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });

    <h4 id="easing">Easing</h4>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4.3</strong>, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="callback-function">Callback Function</h4>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code><a href="/promise/">.promise()</a></code> method can be used in conjunction with the <code><a href="/deferred.done/">deferred.done()</a></code> method to execute a single callback for the animation as a whole when <em>all</em> matching elements have completed their animations ( See the <a href="/promise/#example-1">example for .promise()</a> ).  </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.fadeOut()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

    <p>The <code>.fadeTo()</code> method animates the opacity of the matched elements. It is similar to the <code><a href="/fadeIn/">.fadeIn()</a></code> method but that method unhides the element and always fades to 100% opacity.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied, the default duration of  <code>400</code> milliseconds is used. Unlike the other effect methods, <code>.fadeTo()</code> requires that <code>duration</code> be explicitly specified.</p>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
// With the element initially shown, we can dim it slowly:
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).fadeTo( "slow" , 0.5, function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image four-across">
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_41.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_42.png" alt=""/>

      <img src="/resources/0042_06_44.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>With <code>duration</code> set to <code>0</code>, this method just changes the <code>opacity</code> CSS property, so <code>.fadeTo( 0, opacity )</code> is the same as <code>.css( "opacity", opacity )</code>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.fadeTo()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

As with other pseudo-class selectors (those that begin with a ":") it is recommended to precede it with a tag name or some other selector; otherwise, the universal selector ("*") is implied. In other words, the bare <code>$( ":file" )</code> is equivalent to <code>$("*:file" )</code>, so <code>$( "input:file" )</code> should be used instead. </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:file</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:file</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. For better performance in modern browsers, use <code>[type="file"]</code> instead.

  <longdesc><p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.filter()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements. The supplied selector is tested against each element; all elements matching the selector will be included in the result.</p><p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can apply this method to the set of list items:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).filter( ":even" ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background for items 1, 3, and 5, as they match the selector (recall that <code>:even</code> and <code>:odd</code> use 0-based indexing).</p>
    <h4 id="using-filter-function">Using a Filter Function</h4>
    <p>The second form of this method allows us to filter elements against a function rather than a selector. For each element, if the function returns <code>true</code> (or a "truthy" value), the element will be included in the filtered set; otherwise, it will be excluded. Suppose we have a somewhat more involved HTML snippet:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; item 1 - one strong tag&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; item &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; -
    two &lt;span&gt;strong tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can select the list items, then filter them based on their contents:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" )
  .filter(function( index ) {
    return $( "strong", this ).length === 1;
  })
    .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code will alter the first list item only, as it contains exactly one <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tag. Within the filter function, <code>this</code> refers to each DOM element in turn. The parameter passed to the function tells us the index of that DOM element within the set matched by the jQuery object.</p>
    <p>We can also take advantage of the <code>index</code> passed through the function, which indicates the 0-based position of the element within the unfiltered set of matched elements:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" )
  .filter(function( index ) {
    return index % 3 === 2;
  })
    .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This alteration to the code will cause the third and sixth list items to be highlighted, as it uses the modulus operator (<code>%</code>) to select every item with an <code>index</code> value that, when divided by 3, has a remainder of <code>2</code>.</p>

  <desc>Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.find()</code> method allows us to search through the descendants of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements. The <code>.find()</code> and <code>.children()</code> methods are similar, except that the latter only travels a single level down the DOM tree.</p>
    <p>The first signature for the <code>.find()</code>method accepts a selector expression of the same type that we can pass to the <code>$()</code> function. The elements will be filtered by testing whether they match this selector.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a basic nested list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="level-1"&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-i"&gt;I&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-ii"&gt;II
    &lt;ul class="level-2"&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-a"&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-b"&gt;B
        &lt;ul class="level-3"&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-1"&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-2"&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-3"&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-c"&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-iii"&gt;III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we begin at item II, we can find list items within it:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li.item-ii" ).find( "li" ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background on items A, B, 1, 2, 3, and C. Even though item II matches the selector expression, it is not included in the results; only descendants are considered candidates for the match.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Unlike most of the tree traversal methods, the selector expression is required in a call to <code>.find()</code>. If we need to retrieve all of the descendant elements, we can pass in the universal selector <code>'*'</code> to accomplish this.</p>
    </div>
    <p><a href="/jquery/#selector-context">Selector context</a> is implemented with the <code>.find()</code> <code>method;</code> therefore, <code>$( "li.item-ii" ).find( "li" )</code> is equivalent to <code>$( "li", "li.item-ii" )</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, we can also filter the selection with a given jQuery collection or element. With the same nested list as above, if we start with:</p>
    <pre><code>
var allListElements = $( "li" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>And then pass this jQuery object to find:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li.item-ii" ).find( allListElements );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This will return a jQuery collection which contains only the list elements that are descendants of item II.</p>
    <p>Similarly, an element may also be passed to find:</p>
    <pre><code>
var item1 = $( "li.item-1" )[ 0 ];
$( "li.item-ii" ).find( item1 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call would be a red background on item 1.</p>

  <desc>Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.first()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object from the first element in that set.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can apply this method to the set of list items:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).first().css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background for the first item.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Highlight the first span in a paragraph.</desc>

  <desc>Selects element if it is currently focused.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>As with other pseudo-class selectors (those that begin with a ":"), it is recommended to precede <code>:focus</code> with a tag name or some other selector; otherwise, the universal selector ( "*" ) is implied. In other words, the bare <code>$( ":focus" )</code> is equivalent to <code>$( "*:focus" )</code>.  If you are looking for the currently focused element, <code>$( document.activeElement )</code> will retrieve it without having to search the whole DOM tree.</p>

      <li>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "focus", handler )</code> in the first and second variations, and <code>.trigger( "focus" )</code> in the third.</li>
      <li>The <code>focus</code> event is sent to an element when it gains focus. This event is implicitly applicable to a limited set of elements, such as  form elements (<code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, etc.) and links (<code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>). In recent browser versions, the event can be extended to include all element types by explicitly setting the element's <code>tabindex</code> property. An element can gain focus via keyboard commands, such as the Tab key, or by mouse clicks on the element.</li>
      <li>Elements with focus are usually highlighted in some way by the browser, for example with a dotted line surrounding the element. The focus is used to determine which element is the first to receive keyboard-related events.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Attempting to set focus to a hidden element causes an error in Internet Explorer. Take care to only use <code>.focus()</code> on elements that are visible. To run an element's focus event handlers without setting focus to the element, use <code>.triggerHandler( "focus" )</code> instead of <code>.focus()</code>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input id="target" type="text" value="Field 1"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" value="Field 2"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the first input field:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).focus(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .focus() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now clicking on the first field, or tabbing to it from another field, displays the alert:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .focus() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>We can trigger the event when another element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).focus();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>The <code>focus</code> event does not bubble in Internet Explorer. Therefore, scripts that rely on event delegation with the <code>focus</code> event will not work consistently across browsers. As of version 1.4.2, however, jQuery works around this limitation by mapping <code>focus</code> to the <code>focusin</code> event in its event delegation methods, <a href="/live/"><code>.live()</code></a> and <a href="/delegate/"><code>.delegate()</code></a>.</p>

    <longdesc>
      <p>The <code>.get()</code> method grants access to the DOM nodes underlying each jQuery object. If the value of <code>index</code> is out of bounds — less than the negative number of elements or equal to or greater than the number of elements — it returns <code>undefined</code>. Consider a simple unordered list:</p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li id="foo"&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="bar"&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>With an index specified, <code>.get( index )</code> retrieves a single element:</p>
      <pre><code>
console.log( $( "li" ).get( 0 ) );
      </code></pre>
      <p>Since the index is zero-based, the first list item is returned:</p>
      <p>
        <samp>&lt;li id="foo"&gt;</samp>
      </p>

      <p>Each jQuery object also masquerades as an array, so we can use the array dereferencing operator to get at the list item instead:</p>
      <pre><code>
console.log( $( "li" )[ 0 ] );
      </code></pre>
      <p>However, this syntax lacks some of the additional capabilities of .get(), such as specifying a negative index:</p>
      <pre><code>
console.log( $( "li" ).get( -1 ) );
      </code></pre>
      <p>A negative index is counted from the end of the matched set, so this example returns the last item in the list:</p>

    <p>Note that since JavaScript arrays use <em>0-based indexing</em>, these selectors reflect that fact. This is why <code>$( ".myclass:gt(1)" )</code> selects elements after the second element in the document with the class <code>myclass</code>, rather than after the first. In contrast, <code>:nth-child(n)</code> uses <em>1-based indexing</em> to conform to the CSS specification.</p>

			Because <code>:gt()</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:gt()</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method.

  <desc>Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.has()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements. The supplied selector is tested against the descendants of the matching elements; the element will be included in the result if any of its descendant elements matches the selector.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a nested list as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;list item 2-a&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;list item 2-b&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can apply this method to the set of list items as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).has( "ul" ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background for item 2, as it is the only <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> that has a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> among its descendants.</p>

    <desc>Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements.</desc>
    <longdesc>
      <p>The difference between <code>.css( "height" )</code> and <code>.height()</code> is that the latter returns a unit-less pixel value (for example, <code>400</code>) while the former returns a value with units intact (for example, <code>400px</code>). The <code>.height()</code> method is recommended when an element's height needs to be used in a mathematical calculation.</p>
      <p class="image">
        <img src="/resources/0042_04_01.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>This method is also able to find the height of the window and document.</p>
      <pre><code>
// Returns height of browser viewport
$( window ).height();

// Returns height of HTML document
$( document ).height();
      </code></pre>
      <p>Note that <code>.height()</code> will always return the content height, regardless of the value of the CSS <code>box-sizing</code> property. As of jQuery 1.8, this may require retrieving the CSS height plus <code>box-sizing</code> property and then subtracting any potential border and padding on each element when the element has <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>. To avoid this penalty, use <code>.css( "height" )</code> rather than <code>.height()</code>.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although <code>style</code> and <code>script</code> tags will report a value for <code>.width()</code> or <code>height()</code> when absolutely positioned and given <code>display:block</code>, it is strongly discouraged to call those methods on these tags. In addition to being a bad practice, the results may also prove unreliable.</p>
      </div>
    </longdesc>
    <note>
			The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including <code>.height()</code>, may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer. Also, dimensions may be incorrect when the page is zoomed by the user; browsers do not expose an API to detect this condition.
		</note>
    <note>
			The value reported by <code>.height()</code> is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element's parent is hidden. To get an accurate value, you should show the parent first, before using <code>.height()</code>.

    <p>Elements can be considered hidden for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They have a CSS <code>display</code> value of <code>none</code>.</li>
      <li>They are form elements with <code>type="hidden"</code>.</li>
      <li>Their width and height are explicitly set to 0.</li>
      <li>An ancestor element is hidden, so the element is not shown on the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Elements with <code>visibility: hidden</code> or <code>opacity: 0</code> are considered to be visible, since they still consume space in the layout. During animations that hide an element, the element is considered to be visible until the end of the animation.</p>
    <p>Elements that are not in a document are not considered to be visible; jQuery does not have a way to know if they will be visible when appended to a document since it depends on the applicable styles.</p>
    <p>During animations to show an element, the element is considered to be visible at the start of the animation.</p>
    <p>How <code>:hidden</code> is determined was changed in jQuery 1.3.2. An element is assumed to be hidden if it or any of its parents consumes no space in the document. CSS visibility isn't taken into account (therefore <code>$( elem ).css( "visibility", "hidden" ).is( ":hidden" ) == false</code>). The <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2009/02/20/jquery-1-3-2-released/">release notes</a> outline the changes in more detail.</p>

    <p>With no parameters, the <code>.hide()</code> method is the simplest way to hide an element:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".target" ).hide();
    </code></pre>
    <p>The matched elements will be hidden immediately, with no animation. This is roughly equivalent to calling <code>.css( "display", "none" )</code>, except that the value of the <code>display</code> property is saved in jQuery's data cache so that <code>display</code> can later be restored to its initial value. If an element has a <code>display</code> value of <code>inline</code> and is hidden then shown, it will once again be displayed <code>inline</code>.</p>
    <p>When a duration, a plain object, or a "complete" function is provided, <code>.hide()</code> becomes an animation method. The <code>.hide()</code> method animates the width, height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously. When these properties reach 0, the <code>display</code> style property is set to <code>none</code> to ensure that the element no longer affects the layout of the page.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively.</p>
    <p>Note that <code>.hide()</code> is fired immediately and will override the animation queue if no duration or a duration of 0 is specified.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery <strong>1.4.3</strong>, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code>
// With the element initially shown, we can hide it slowly:
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).hide( "slow", function() {
    alert( "Animation complete." );
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image four-across">
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_05.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_06.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_07.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_08.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.hide()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

    <desc>Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements.</desc>
    <longdesc>
      <p>This method is not available on XML documents.</p>
      <p>In an HTML document, <code>.html()</code> can be used to get the contents of any element. If the selector expression matches more than one element, only the first match will have its HTML content returned. Consider this code:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div.demo-container" ).html();
      </code></pre>
      <p>In order for the following <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s content to be retrieved, it would have to be the first one with <code>class="demo-container"</code> in the document:</p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="demo-box"&gt;Demonstration Box&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>The result would look like this:</p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;div class="demo-box"&gt;Demonstration Box&lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>This method uses the browser's <code>innerHTML</code> property. Some browsers may not return HTML that exactly replicates the HTML source in an original document. For example, Internet Explorer sometimes leaves off the quotes around attribute values if they contain only alphanumeric characters.</p>
    </longdesc>
    <note>
			By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — <a href="/jQuery/">jQuery()</a>, <a href="/append/">.append()</a>, <a href="/after/">.after()</a>, etc. — can potentially execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code (for example, <code>&lt;img onload=""&gt;</code>). Do not use these methods to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

      <desc>Click a paragraph to convert it from html to text.</desc>

$( "p" ).click(function() {

        <desc>A function returning the HTML content to set. Receives the

      <p>The <code>.html()</code> method is not available in XML documents. </p>
      <p>When <code>.html()</code> is used to set an element's content,
      any content that was in that element is completely replaced by the new content.
      Additionally, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event
      handlers from child elements before replacing those elements with the new content.</p>

      <p>Consider the following HTML:</p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="demo-box"&gt;Demonstration Box&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>The content of <code>&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;</code> can be set like this:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div.demo-container" )
  .html( "&lt;p&gt;All new content. &lt;em&gt;You bet!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" );
      </code></pre>
      <p>That line of code will replace everything inside <code>&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All new content. &lt;em&gt;You bet!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>As of jQuery 1.4, the <code>.html()</code> method allows the HTML content to be set by passing in a function.</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div.demo-container" ).html(function() {
  var emphasis = "&lt;em&gt;" + $( "p" ).length + " paragraphs!&lt;/em&gt;";
  return "&lt;p&gt;All new content for " + emphasis + "&lt;/p&gt;";
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>Given a document with six paragraphs, this example will set the HTML of <code>&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;p&gt;All new content for &lt;em&gt;6 paragraphs!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p>
      <p>This method uses the browser's <code>innerHTML</code> property. Some browsers may not generate a DOM that exactly replicates the HTML source provided. For example, Internet Explorer prior to version 8 will convert all <code>href</code> properties on links to absolute URLs, and Internet Explorer prior to version 9 will not correctly handle HTML5 elements without the addition of a separate <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/">compatibility layer</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Internet Explorer up to and including version 9, setting the text content of an HTML element may corrupt the text nodes of its children that are being removed from the document as a result of the operation. If you are keeping references to these DOM elements and need them to be unchanged, use <code>.empty().html( string )</code> instead of <code>.html(string)</code> so that the elements are removed from the document before the new string is assigned to the element.</p>

    <p>For id selectors, jQuery uses the JavaScript function <code>document.getElementById()</code>, which is extremely efficient. When another selector is attached to the id selector, such as <code>h2#pageTitle</code>, jQuery performs an additional check before identifying the element as a match.</p>
    <p>Calling <code>jQuery()</code> (or <code>$()</code>) with an id selector as its argument will return a jQuery object containing a collection of either zero or one DOM element.</p>
    <p>Each <code>id</code> value must be used only once within a document. If more than one element has been assigned the same ID, queries that use that ID will only select the first matched element in the DOM. This behavior should not be relied on, however; a document with more than one element using the same ID is invalid.</p>
    <p>If the id contains characters like periods or colons you have to <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/">escape those characters with backslashes</a>.</p>

    <h4>Return Values</h4>
    <p>If no argument is passed to the <code>.index()</code> method, the return value is an integer indicating the position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to its sibling elements.</p>
    <p>If <code>.index()</code> is called on a collection of elements and a DOM element or jQuery object is passed in, <code>.index()</code> returns an integer indicating the position of the passed element relative to the original collection.</p>
    <p>If a selector string is passed as an argument, <code>.index()</code> returns an integer indicating the position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to the elements matched by the selector. If the element is not found, <code>.index()</code> will return -1.</p>
    <h4>Detail</h4>
    <p>The complementary operation to <code>.get()</code>, which accepts an index and returns a DOM node, <code>.index()</code> can take a DOM node and returns an index. Suppose we have a simple unordered list on the page:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li id="foo"&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="bar"&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="baz"&gt;baz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we retrieve one of the three list items (for example, through a DOM function or as the context to an event handler), <code>.index()</code> can search for this list item within the set of matched elements:</p>
    <pre><code>
var listItem = document.getElementById( "bar" );
alert( "Index: " + $( "li" ).index( listItem ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>We get back the zero-based position of the list item:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Index: 1</samp>
    </p>
    <p>Similarly, if we retrieve a jQuery object consisting of one of the three list items, <code>.index()</code> will search for that list item:</p>
    <pre><code>
var listItem = $( "#bar" );
alert( "Index: " + $( "li" ).index( listItem ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>We get back the zero-based position of the list item:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Index: 1</samp>
    </p>
    <p>Note that if the jQuery collection used as the <code>.index()</code> method's argument contains more than one element, the first element within the matched set of elements will be used.</p>
    <pre><code>
var listItems = $( "li:gt(0)" );
alert( "Index: " + $( "li" ).index( listItems ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>We get back the zero-based position of the first list item within the matched set:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Index: 1</samp>
    </p>
    <p>If we use a string as the <code>.index()</code> method's argument, it is interpreted as a jQuery selector string. The first element among the object's matched elements which also matches this selector is located.</p>
    <pre><code>
var listItem = $( "#bar" );
alert( "Index: " + listItem.index( "li" ) );
    </code></pre>
    <p>We get back the zero-based position of the list item:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Index: 1</samp>
    </p>
    <p>If we omit the argument, <code>.index()</code> will return the position of the first element within the set of matched elements in relation to its siblings:</p>
    <pre><code>
alert( "Index: " + $( "#bar" ).index() );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Again, we get back the zero-based position of the list item:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Index: 1</samp>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Before jQuery 1.9,</strong> the append-to-single-element case did not create a new set, but instead returned the original set which made it difficult to use the <code>.end()</code> method reliably when being used with an unknown number of elements.</p>

  <note>
			By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — <a href="/jQuery/">jQuery()</a>, <a href="/append/">.append()</a>, <a href="/after/">.after()</a>, etc. — can potentially execute code. This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code (for example, <code>&lt;img onload=""&gt;</code>). Do not use these methods to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

Do not use these methods to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

  <longdesc>
    <p>Unlike other filtering methods, <code>.is()</code> does not create a new jQuery object. Instead, it allows you to test the contents of a jQuery object without modification. This is often useful inside callbacks, such as event handlers.</p>
    <p>Suppose you have a list, with two of its items containing a child element:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list &lt;strong&gt;item 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;list item 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can attach a click handler to the &lt;ul&gt; element, and then limit the code to be triggered only when a list item itself, not one of its children, is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "ul" ).click(function( event ) {
  var target = $( event.target );
  if ( target.is( "li" ) ) {
    target.css( "background-color", "red" );
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now, when the user clicks on the word "list" in the first item or anywhere in the third item, the clicked list item will be given a red background. However, when the user clicks on item 1 in the first item or anywhere in the second item, nothing will occur, because in those cases the target of the event would be <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, respectively.</p>
    <p>Prior to jQuery 1.7, in selector strings with positional selectors such as <code>:first</code>, <code>:gt()</code>, or <code>:even</code>, the positional filtering is done against the jQuery object passed to <code>.is()</code>, <em>not</em> against the containing document. So for the HTML shown above, an expression such as <code>$( "li:first" ).is( "li:last" )</code> returns <code>true</code>, but <code>$( "li:first-child" ).is( "li:last-child" )</code> returns <code>false</code>. In addition, a bug in Sizzle prevented many positional selectors from working properly. These two factors made positional selectors almost unusable in filters.</p>
    <p>Starting with jQuery 1.7, selector strings with positional selectors apply the selector against the document, and then determine whether the first element of the current jQuery set matches any of the resulting elements. So for the HTML shown above, an expression such as <code>$( "li:first" ).is( "li:last" )</code> returns <code>false</code>. Note that since positional selectors are jQuery additions and not W3C standard, we recommend using the W3C selectors whenever feasible.</p>
    <h4>Using a Function</h4>
    <p>The second form of this method evaluates expressions related to elements based on a function rather than a selector. For each element, if the function returns <code>true</code>, <code>.is()</code> returns <code>true</code> as well. For example, given a somewhat more involved HTML snippet:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; item 1 - one strong tag&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; item &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; -
    two &lt;span&gt;strong tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can attach a click handler to every <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> that evaluates the number of <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements within the clicked <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> at that time like so:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).click(function() {
  var li = $( this ),
    isWithTwo = li.is(function() {
      return $( "strong", this ).length === 2;
    });
  if ( isWithTwo ) {
    li.css( "background-color", "green" );
  } else {
    li.css( "background-color", "red" );
  }
});

  <title>jQuery.Callbacks()</title>
  <signature>

    <argument name="flags" type="String">
      <desc>An optional list of space-separated flags that change how the callback list behaves.</desc>
    </argument>
  </signature>
  <desc>A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>$.Callbacks()</code> function is internally used to provide the base functionality behind the jQuery <code>$.ajax()</code> and <code>$.Deferred()</code> components. It can be used as a similar base to define functionality for new components.</p>
    <p><code>$.Callbacks()</code> supports a number of methods including <code><a href="/callbacks.add/">callbacks.add()</a></code>,<code><a href="/callbacks.remove/">callbacks.remove()</a></code>, <code><a href="/callbacks.fire/">callbacks.fire()</a></code> and <code><a href="/callbacks.disable/">callbacks.disable()</a></code>.</p>
    <h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
    <p>The following are two sample methods named <code>fn1</code> and <code>fn2</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
function fn1( value ) {
  console.log( value );
}

function fn2( value ) {
  console.log( "fn2 says: " + value );
  return false;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>These can be added as callbacks to a <code>$.Callbacks</code> list and invoked as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
var callbacks = $.Callbacks();
callbacks.add( fn1 );

// Outputs: foo!
callbacks.fire( "foo!" );

callbacks.add( fn2 );

// Outputs: bar!, fn2 says: bar!
callbacks.fire( "bar!" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this is that it becomes simple to construct complex lists of callbacks where input values can be passed through to as many functions as needed with ease.</p>
    <p>Two specific methods were being used above: <code>.add()</code> and <code>.fire()</code>. The <code>.add()</code> method supports adding new callbacks to the callback list, while the <code>.fire()</code> method executes the added functions and provides a way to pass arguments to be processed by the callbacks in the same list.</p>
    <p>Another method supported by <code>$.Callbacks</code> is <code>.remove()</code>, which has the ability to remove a particular callback from the callback list. Here"s a practical example of <code>.remove()</code> being used:</p>
    <pre><code>
var callbacks = $.Callbacks();
callbacks.add( fn1 );

// Outputs: foo!
callbacks.fire( "foo!" );

callbacks.add( fn2 );

// Outputs: bar!, fn2 says: bar!
callbacks.fire( "bar!" );

callbacks.remove( fn2 );

// Only outputs foobar, as fn2 has been removed.
callbacks.fire( "foobar" );
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id="supported-flags">Supported Flags</h3>
    <p>The <code>flags</code> argument is an optional argument to <code>$.Callbacks()</code>, structured as a list of space-separated strings that change how the callback list behaves (eg. <code>$.Callbacks( "unique stopOnFalse" )</code>).</p>
    <h2>Possible flags:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><code>once</code>: Ensures the callback list can only be fired once (like a Deferred).</li>
      <li><code>memory</code>: Keeps track of previous values and will call any callback added after the list has been fired right away with the latest "memorized" values (like a Deferred).</li>
      <li><code>unique</code>: Ensures a callback can only be added once (so there are no duplicates in the list).</li>
      <li><code>stopOnFalse</code>: Interrupts callings when a callback returns false.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By default a callback list will act like an event callback list and can be "fired" multiple times.</p>
    <p>For examples of how <code>flags</code> should ideally be used, see below:</p>
    <h2 id="once"><code>$.Callbacks( "once" )</code>:</h2>
    <pre><code>
var callbacks = $.Callbacks( "once" );
callbacks.add( fn1 );
callbacks.fire( "foo" );
callbacks.add( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "bar" );
callbacks.remove( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "foobar" );

/*
output:
foo
*/
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="memory"><code>$.Callbacks( "memory" )</code>:</h2>
    <pre><code>
var callbacks = $.Callbacks( "memory" );
callbacks.add( fn1 );
callbacks.fire( "foo" );
callbacks.add( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "bar" );
callbacks.remove( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "foobar" );

/*
output:
foo
fn2 says:foo
bar
fn2 says:bar
foobar
*/
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="unique"><code>$.Callbacks( "unique" )</code>:</h2>
    <pre><code>
var callbacks = $.Callbacks( "unique" );
callbacks.add( fn1 );
callbacks.fire( "foo" );
callbacks.add( fn1 ); // Repeat addition
callbacks.add( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "bar" );
callbacks.remove( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "foobar" );

/*
output:
foo
bar
fn2 says:bar
foobar
*/
    </code></pre>
    <h2 id="stopOnFalse"><code>$.Callbacks( "stopOnFalse" )</code>:</h2>
    <pre><code>
function fn1( value ) {
  console.log( value );
  return false;
}

function fn2( value ) {
  fn1( "fn2 says: " + value );
  return false;
}

var callbacks = $.Callbacks( "stopOnFalse" );
callbacks.add( fn1 );
callbacks.fire( "foo" );
callbacks.add( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "bar" );
callbacks.remove( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "foobar" );

/*
output:
foo
bar
foobar
*/
    </code></pre>
    <p>Because <code>$.Callbacks()</code> supports a list of flags rather than just one, setting several flags has a cumulative effect similar to "&amp;&amp;". This means it's possible to combine flags to create callback lists that, say, both are <i>unique</i> and <i>ensure if list was already fired, adding more callbacks will have it called with the latest fired value</i> (i.e. <code>$.Callbacks("unique memory")</code>).</p>
    <h2 id="unique-memory"><code>$.Callbacks( 'unique memory' )</code>:</h2>
    <pre><code>
function fn1( value ) {
  console.log( value );
  return false;
}

function fn2( value ) {
  fn1( "fn2 says: " + value );
  return false;
}

var callbacks = $.Callbacks( "unique memory" );
callbacks.add( fn1 );
callbacks.fire( "foo" );
callbacks.add( fn1 ); // Repeat addition
callbacks.add( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "bar" );
callbacks.add( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "baz" );
callbacks.remove( fn2 );
callbacks.fire( "foobar" );

/*
output:
foo
fn2 says:foo
bar
fn2 says:bar
baz
fn2 says:baz
foobar
*/
</code></pre>
    <p>Flag combinations with <code>$.Callbacks()</code> are internally in jQuery for the <code>.done()</code> and <code>.fail()</code> functions on a Deferred — both of which use <code>$.Callbacks('memory once')</code>.</p>
    <p>The methods of <code>$.Callbacks</code> can also be detached, should there be a need to define short-hand versions for convenience:</p>
    <pre><code>
var callbacks = $.Callbacks(),
  add = callbacks.add,
  remove = callbacks.remove,
  fire = callbacks.fire;

add( fn1 );
fire( "hello world" );
remove( fn1 );
    </code></pre>
    <h3 id="pubsub">$.Callbacks, $.Deferred and Pub/Sub</h3>
    <p>The general idea behind pub/sub (Publish/Subscribe, or, the Observer pattern) is the promotion of loose coupling in applications. Rather than single objects calling on the methods of other objects, an object instead subscribes to a specific task or activity of another object and is notified when it occurs. Observers are also called Subscribers, and we refer to the object being observed as the Publisher (or the subject). Publishers notify subscribers when events occur.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate the component-creation capabilities of <code>$.Callbacks()</code>, it's possible to implement a Pub/Sub system using only callback lists. Using <code>$.Callbacks</code> as a topics queue, a system for publishing and subscribing to topics can be implemented as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
var topics = {};

jQuery.Topic = function( id ) {
  var callbacks, method,
    topic = id &amp;&amp; topics[ id ];

  if ( !topic ) {
    callbacks = jQuery.Callbacks();
    topic = {
      publish: callbacks.fire,
      subscribe: callbacks.add,
      unsubscribe: callbacks.remove
    };
    if ( id ) {
      topics[ id ] = topic;
    }
  }
  return topic;
};
    </code></pre>
    <p>This can then be used by parts of your application to publish and subscribe to events of interest quite easily:</p>
    <pre><code>
// Subscribers
$.Topic( "mailArrived" ).subscribe( fn1 );
$.Topic( "mailArrived" ).subscribe( fn2 );
$.Topic( "mailSent" ).subscribe( fn1 );

// Publisher
$.Topic( "mailArrived" ).publish( "hello world!" );
$.Topic( "mailSent" ).publish( "woo! mail!" );

// Here, "hello world!" gets pushed to fn1 and fn2
// when the "mailArrived" notification is published
// with "woo! mail!" also being pushed to fn1 when
// the "mailSent" notification is published.

/*
output:
hello world!
fn2 says: hello world!
woo! mail!
*/
    </code></pre>
    <p>While this is useful, the implementation can be taken further. Using <code>$.Deferreds</code>,  it's possible to ensure publishers only publish notifications for subscribers once particular tasks have been completed (resolved). See the below code sample for some further comments on how this could be used in practice:</p>
    <pre><code>
// Subscribe to the mailArrived notification
$.Topic( "mailArrived" ).subscribe( fn1 );

// Create a new instance of Deferreds
var dfd = $.Deferred();

// Define a new topic (without directly publishing)
var topic = $.Topic( "mailArrived" );

// When the deferred has been resolved, publish a
// notification to subscribers
dfd.done( topic.publish );

// Here the Deferred is being resolved with a message
// that will be passed back to subscribers. It's possible to
// easily integrate this into a more complex routine
// (eg. waiting on an ajax call to complete) so that
// messages are only published once the task has actually
// finished.
dfd.resolve( "it's been published!" );
    </code></pre>

  </signature>
  <desc> A constructor function that returns a chainable utility object with methods to register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>jQuery.Deferred()</code> constructor creates a new Deferred object. The <code>new</code> operator is optional.</p>
    <p>The <code>jQuery.Deferred</code> method can be passed an optional function, which is called just before the constructor returns and is passed the constructed <code>deferred</code> object as both the <code>this</code> object and as the first argument to the function. The called function can attach callbacks using <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, for example.</p>
    <p>A Deferred object starts in the <em>pending</em> state. Any callbacks added to the object with <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.always/"><code>deferred.always()</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.done/"><code>deferred.done()</code></a>, or <a href="/deferred.fail/"><code>deferred.fail()</code></a> are queued to be executed later. Calling <a href="/deferred.resolve/"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.resolveWith/"><code>deferred.resolveWith()</code></a> transitions the Deferred into the <em>resolved</em> state and immediately executes any <code>doneCallbacks</code> that are set. Calling <a href="/deferred.reject/"><code>deferred.reject()</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.rejectWith/"><code>deferred.rejectWith()</code></a> transitions the Deferred into the <em>rejected</em> state and immediately executes any <code>failCallbacks</code> that are set. Once the object has entered the resolved or rejected state, it stays in that state. Callbacks can still be added to the resolved or rejected Deferred — they will execute immediately.</p>
    <h4>
      Enhanced Callbacks with jQuery Deferred
    </h4>
    <p>In JavaScript it is common to invoke functions that optionally accept callbacks that are called within that function. For example, in versions prior to jQuery 1.5, asynchronous processes such as <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> accept callbacks to be invoked some time in the near-future upon success, error, and completion of the ajax request.</p>
    <p><code>jQuery.Deferred()</code> introduces several enhancements to the way callbacks are managed and invoked. In particular, <code>jQuery.Deferred()</code> provides flexible ways to provide multiple callbacks, and these callbacks can be invoked regardless of whether the original callback dispatch has already occurred. jQuery Deferred is based on the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A">CommonJS Promises/A</a> design.</p>
    <p>One model for understanding Deferred is to think of it as a chain-aware function wrapper. The <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.always/"><code>deferred.always()</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.done/"><code>deferred.done()</code></a>, and <a href="/deferred.fail/"><code>deferred.fail()</code></a> methods specify the functions to be called and the <a href="/deferred.resolve/"><code>deferred.resolve(args)</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.reject/"><code>deferred.reject(args)</code></a> methods "call" the functions with the arguments you supply. Once the Deferred has been resolved or rejected it stays in that state; a second call to <code>deferred.resolve()</code>, for example, is ignored. If more functions are added by <code>deferred.then()</code>, for example, after the Deferred is resolved, they are called immediately with the arguments previously provided.</p>
    <p>In most cases where a jQuery API call returns a Deferred or Deferred-compatible object, such as <a href="/jQuery.ajax/"><code>jQuery.ajax()</code></a> or <a href="/jQuery.when/"><code>jQuery.when()</code></a>, you will only want to use the <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.done/"><code>deferred.done()</code></a>, and <a href="/deferred.fail/"><code>deferred.fail()</code></a> methods to add callbacks to the Deferred's queues. The internals of the API call or code that created the Deferred will invoke <a href="/deferred.resolve/"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.reject/"><code>deferred.reject()</code></a> on the deferred at some point, causing the appropriate callbacks to run.</p>

        <desc>When sending data to the server, use this content type. Default is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8", which is fine for most cases. If you explicitly pass in a content-type to <code>$.ajax()</code>, then it is always sent to the server (even if no data is sent). The W3C XMLHttpRequest specification dictates that the charset is always UTF-8; specifying another charset will not force the browser to change the encoding. <strong>Note:</strong> For cross-domain requests, setting the content type to anything other than <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, or <code>text/plain</code> will trigger the browser to send a preflight OPTIONS request to the server.</desc>

      </property>
      <property name="dataType" default="Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)" type="String">
        <desc>The type of data that you're expecting back from the server. If none is specified, jQuery will try to infer it based on the MIME type of the response (an XML MIME type will yield XML, in 1.4 JSON will yield a JavaScript object, in 1.4 script will execute the script, and anything else will be returned as a string). The available types (and the result passed as the first argument to your success callback) are:
          <ul><li>"xml": Returns a XML document that can be processed via jQuery.</li><li>"html": Returns HTML as plain text; included script tags are evaluated when inserted in the DOM.</li><li>"script": Evaluates the response as JavaScript and returns it as plain text. Disables caching by appending a query string parameter, "_=[TIMESTAMP]", to the URL unless the <code>cache</code> option is set to <code>true</code>. <strong>Note:</strong> This will turn POSTs into GETs for remote-domain requests. </li><li>"json": Evaluates the response as JSON and returns a JavaScript object. The JSON data is parsed in a strict manner; any malformed JSON is rejected and a parse error is thrown. As of jQuery 1.9, an empty response is also rejected; the server should return a response of <code>null</code> or <code>{}</code> instead. (See <a href="http://json.org/">json.org</a> for more information on proper JSON formatting.)</li><li>"jsonp": Loads in a JSON block using <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/">JSONP</a>. Adds an extra "?callback=?" to the end of your URL to specify the callback. Disables caching by appending a query string parameter, "_=[TIMESTAMP]", to the URL unless the <code>cache</code> option is set to <code>true</code>.</li><li>"text": A plain text string.</li><li>multiple, space-separated values: <strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, jQuery can convert a dataType from what it received in the Content-Type header to what you require. For example, if you want a text response to be treated as XML, use "text xml" for the dataType. You can also make a JSONP request, have it received as text, and interpreted by jQuery as XML: "jsonp text xml." Similarly, a shorthand string such as "jsonp xml" will first attempt to convert from jsonp to xml, and, failing that, convert from jsonp to text, and then from text to xml.

        <desc>A function to be called if the request fails. The function receives three arguments: The jqXHR (in jQuery 1.4.x, XMLHttpRequest) object, a string describing the type of error that occurred and an optional exception object, if one occurred. Possible values for the second argument (besides <code>null</code>) are <code>"timeout"</code>, <code>"error"</code>, <code>"abort"</code>, and <code>"parsererror"</code>. When an HTTP error occurs, <code>errorThrown</code> receives the textual portion of the HTTP status, such as "Not Found" or "Internal Server Error."  <strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, the <code>error</code> setting can accept an array of functions.

      <property name="headers" type="PlainObject" default="{}" added="1.5">
        <desc>An object of additional header key/value pairs to send along with requests using the XMLHttpRequest transport. The header <code>X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest</code> is always added, but its default <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> value can be changed here.  Values in the <code>headers</code> setting can also be overwritten from within the <code>beforeSend</code> function.</desc>

      <property default="false" name="ifModified" type="Boolean">
        <desc>Allow the request to be successful only if the response has changed since the last request. This is done by checking the Last-Modified header.

      <property default="depends on current location protocol" name="isLocal" type="Boolean" added="1.5.1">
        <desc>Allow the current environment to be recognized as "local," (e.g. the filesystem), even if jQuery does not recognize it as such by default. The following protocols are currently recognized as local: <code>file</code>, <code>*-extension</code>, and <code>widget</code>. If the <code>isLocal</code> setting needs modification, it is recommended to do so once in the <code>$.ajaxSetup()</code> method.  </desc>
      </property>
      <property name="jsonp" type="String">
        <desc>Override the callback function name in a JSONP request.  This value will be used instead of 'callback' in the 'callback=?' part of the query string in the url.  So <code>{jsonp:'onJSONPLoad'}</code> would result in <code>'onJSONPLoad=?'</code> passed to the server. <strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, setting the <code>jsonp</code> option to <code>false</code> prevents jQuery from adding the "?callback" string to the URL or attempting to use "=?" for transformation. In this case, you should also explicitly set the <code>jsonpCallback</code> setting. For example, <code>{ jsonp: false, jsonpCallback: "callbackName" }</code></desc>

        <type name="Function"/>
        <desc>Specify the callback function name for a JSONP request.  This value will be used instead of the random name automatically generated by jQuery. It is preferable to let jQuery generate a unique name as it'll make it easier to manage the requests and provide callbacks and error handling. You may want to specify the callback when you want to enable better browser caching of GET requests. <strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, you can also use a function for this setting, in which case the value of <code>jsonpCallback</code> is set to the return value of that function. </desc>

      <property name="scriptCharset" type="String">
        <desc>Only applies when the "script" transport is used (e.g., cross-domain requests with "jsonp" or "script" dataType and "GET" type). Sets the <code>charset</code> attribute on the script tag used in the request. Used when the character set on the local page is not the same as the one on the remote script.</desc>

        <desc>
          <p>An object of numeric HTTP codes and functions to be called when the response has the corresponding code. For example, the following will alert when the response status is a 404:</p>

      <property name="timeout" type="Number">
        <desc>Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request. This will override any global timeout set with <a href="/jQuery.ajaxSetup/">$.ajaxSetup()</a>. The timeout period starts at the point the <code>$.ajax</code> call is made; if several other requests are in progress and the browser has no connections available, it is possible for a request to time out before it can be sent. <strong>In jQuery 1.4.x and below,</strong> the XMLHttpRequest object will be in an invalid state if the request times out; accessing any object members may throw an exception. <strong>In Firefox 3.0+ only,</strong> script and JSONP requests cannot be cancelled by a timeout; the script will run even if it arrives after the timeout period.</desc>

  <desc>Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>$.ajax()</code> function underlies all Ajax requests sent by jQuery.  It is often unnecessary to directly call this function, as several higher-level alternatives like <code><a href="/jQuery.get/">$.get()</a></code> and <code><a href="/load/">.load()</a></code> are available and are easier to use. If less common options are required, though, <code>$.ajax()</code> can be used more flexibly.</p>
    <p>At its simplest, the <code>$.ajax()</code> function can be called with no arguments:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajax();
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Default settings can be set globally by using the <code><a href="/jQuery.ajaxSetup/">$.ajaxSetup()</a></code> function.</p>
    <p>This example, using no options, loads the contents of the current page, but does nothing with the result. To use the result, you can implement one of the callback functions.</p>
    <h4 id="jqXHR">The jqXHR Object</h4>
    <p>The jQuery XMLHttpRequest (jqXHR) object returned by <code>$.ajax()</code> <strong>as of jQuery 1.5</strong> is a superset of the browser's native XMLHttpRequest object. For example, it contains <code>responseText</code> and <code>responseXML</code> properties, as well as a <code>getResponseHeader()</code> method. When the transport mechanism is something other than XMLHttpRequest (for example, a script tag for a JSONP request) the <code>jqXHR</code> object simulates native XHR functionality where possible. </p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5.1</strong>, the <code>jqXHR</code> object also contains the <code>overrideMimeType()</code> method (it was available in jQuery 1.4.x, as well, but was temporarily removed in jQuery 1.5). The <code>.overrideMimeType()</code> method may be used in the <code>beforeSend()</code> callback function, for example, to modify the response content-type header:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajax({
  url: "http://fiddle.jshell.net/favicon.png",
  beforeSend: function( xhr ) {
    xhr.overrideMimeType( "text/plain; charset=x-user-defined" );
  }
})
  .done(function( data ) {
    if ( console &amp;&amp; console.log ) {
      console.log( "Sample of data:", data.slice( 0, 100 ) );
    }
  });
    </code></pre>
    <p>The jqXHR objects returned by <code>$.ajax()</code> as of jQuery 1.5 implement the Promise interface, giving them all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a> for more information). These methods take one or more function arguments that are called when the <code>$.ajax()</code> request terminates. This allows you to assign multiple callbacks on a single request, and even to assign callbacks after the request may have completed. (If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.) Available Promise methods of the jqXHR object include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>jqXHR.done(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {});</strong>
        <p>An alternative construct to the success callback option, the <code>.done()</code> method replaces the deprecated <code>jqXHR.success()</code> method. Refer to <code><a href="/deferred.done/">deferred.done()</a></code> for implementation details.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>jqXHR.fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});</strong>
        <p>An alternative construct to the error callback option, the <code>.fail()</code> method replaces the deprecated <code>.error()</code> method. Refer to <code><a href="/deferred.fail/">deferred.fail()</a></code> for implementation details.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>jqXHR.always(function( data|jqXHR, textStatus, jqXHR|errorThrown ) { });</strong>
        <p>An alternative construct to the complete callback option, the <code>.always()</code> method replaces the deprecated <code>.complete()</code> method.</p>
        <p>In response to a successful request, the function's arguments are the same as those of <code>.done()</code>: data, textStatus, and the jqXHR object. For failed requests the arguments are the same as those of <code>.fail()</code>: the jqXHR object, textStatus, and errorThrown. Refer to <code><a href="/deferred.always/">deferred.always()</a></code> for implementation details.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>jqXHR.then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {}, function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});</strong>
        <p>Incorporates the functionality of the <code>.done()</code> and <code>.fail()</code> methods, allowing (as of jQuery 1.8) the underlying Promise to be manipulated. Refer to <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then()</code></a> for implementation details.

    </ul>
    <p>No <code>onreadystatechange</code> mechanism is provided, however, since <code>done</code>, <code>fail</code>, <code>always</code>, and <code>statusCode</code> cover all conceivable requirements.</p>
    <h4 id="callback-functions">Callback Function Queues</h4>
    <p>The <code>beforeSend</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>dataFilter</code>, <code>success</code> and <code>complete</code> options all accept callback functions that are invoked at the appropriate times.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, the <code>fail</code> and <code>done</code>, and, as of jQuery 1.6, <code>always</code> callback hooks are first-in, first-out managed queues, allowing for more than one callback for each hook. See <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object methods</a>, which are implemented internally for these <code>$.ajax()</code> callback hooks.</p>
    <p>The callback hooks provided by <code>$.ajax()</code> are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>beforeSend</code> callback option is invoked; it receives the <code>jqXHR</code> object and the <code>settings</code> object as parameters.</li>
      <li><code>error</code> callback option is invoked, if the request fails. It receives the <code>jqXHR</code>, a string indicating the error type, and an exception object if applicable. Some built-in errors will provide a string as the exception object: "abort", "timeout", "No Transport".</li>
      <li><code>dataFilter</code> callback option is invoked immediately upon successful receipt of response data. It receives the returned data and the value of <code>dataType</code>, and must return the (possibly altered) data to pass on to <code>success</code>.</li>
      <li><code>success</code> callback option is invoked, if the request succeeds. It receives the returned data, a string containing the success code, and the <code>jqXHR</code> object.</li>
      <li><strong>Promise callbacks</strong> — <code>.done()</code>, <code>.fail()</code>, <code>.always()</code>, and <code>.then()</code> — are invoked, in the order they are registered. </li>
      <li><code>complete</code> callback option fires, when the request finishes, whether in failure or success. It receives the <code>jqXHR</code> object, as well as a string containing the success or error code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="data-types">Data Types</h4>
    <p>Different types of response to <code>$.ajax()</code> call are subjected to different kinds of pre-processing before being passed to the success handler. The type of pre-processing depends by default upon the Content-Type of the response, but can be set explicitly using the <code>dataType</code> option. If the <code>dataType</code> option is provided, the Content-Type header of the response will be disregarded.</p>
    <p>The available data types are <code>text</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>xml</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>jsonp</code>, and <code>script</code>.</p>
    <p>If <code>text</code> or <code>html</code> is specified, no pre-processing occurs. The data is simply passed on to the success handler, and made available through the <code>responseText</code> property of the <code>jqXHR</code> object.</p>
    <p>If <code>xml</code> is specified, the response is parsed using <a href="/jQuery.parseXML/"><code>jQuery.parseXML</code></a> before being passed, as an <a href="http://api.jquery.com/Types/#XMLDocument"><code>XMLDocument</code></a>, to the success handler. The XML document is made available through the <code>responseXML</code> property of the <code>jqXHR</code> object.</p>
    <p>If <code>json</code> is specified, the response is parsed using <a href="/jQuery.parseJSON/"><code>jQuery.parseJSON</code></a> before being passed, as an object, to the success handler. The parsed JSON object is made available through the <code>responseJSON</code> property of the <code>jqXHR</code> object.</p>
    <p>If <code>script</code> is specified, <code>$.ajax()</code> will execute the JavaScript that is received from the server before passing it on to the success handler as a string.</p>
    <p>If <code>jsonp</code> is specified, <code>$.ajax()</code> will automatically append a query string parameter of (by default) <code>callback=?</code> to the URL. The <code>jsonp</code> and <code>jsonpCallback</code> properties of the settings passed to <code>$.ajax()</code> can be used to specify, respectively, the name of the query string parameter and the name of the JSONP callback function. The server should return valid JavaScript that passes the JSON response into the callback function. <code>$.ajax()</code> will execute the returned JavaScript, calling the JSONP callback function, before passing the JSON object contained in the response to the <code>$.ajax()</code> success handler.</p>
    <p>For more information on JSONP, see the <a href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/">original post detailing its use</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="sending-data-to-server">Sending Data to the Server</h4>
    <p>By default, Ajax requests are sent using the GET HTTP method. If the POST method is required, the method can be specified by setting a value for the <code>type</code> option. This option affects how the contents of the <code>data</code> option are sent to the server. POST data will always be transmitted to the server using UTF-8 charset, per the W3C XMLHTTPRequest standard.</p>
    <p>The <code>data</code> option can contain either a query string of the form <code>key1=value1&amp;key2=value2</code>, or an object of the form <code>{key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}</code>. If the latter form is used, the data is converted into a query string using <code><a href="/jQuery.param/">jQuery.param()</a></code> before it is sent. This processing can be circumvented by setting <code>processData</code> to <code>false</code>.  The processing might be undesirable if you wish to send an XML object to the server; in this case, change the <code>contentType</code> option from <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> to a more appropriate MIME type.</p>
    <h4 id="advanced-options">Advanced Options</h4>
    <p>The <code>global</code> option prevents handlers registered using <code><a href="/ajaxSend/">.ajaxSend()</a></code>, <code><a href="/ajaxError/">.ajaxError()</a></code>, and similar methods from firing when this request would trigger them. This can be useful to, for example, suppress a loading indicator that was implemented with <code><a href="/ajaxSend/">.ajaxSend()</a></code> if the requests are frequent and brief. With cross-domain script and JSONP requests, the global option is automatically set to <code>false</code>. See the descriptions of these methods below for more details.  See the descriptions of these methods below for more details.</p>
    <p>If the server performs HTTP authentication before providing a response, the user name and password pair can be sent via the <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> options.</p>
    <p>Ajax requests are time-limited, so errors can be caught and handled to provide a better user experience. Request timeouts are usually either left at their default or set as a global default using <code><a href="/jQuery.ajaxSetup/">$.ajaxSetup()</a></code> rather than being overridden for specific requests with the <code>timeout</code> option.</p>
    <p>By default, requests are always issued, but the browser may serve results out of its cache. To disallow use of the cached results, set <code>cache</code> to <code>false</code>. To cause the request to report failure if the asset has not been modified since the last request, set <code>ifModified</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>scriptCharset</code> allows the character set to be explicitly specified for requests that use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag (that is, a type of <code>script</code> or <code>jsonp</code>). This is useful if the script and host page have differing character sets.</p>
    <p>The first letter in Ajax stands for "asynchronous," meaning that the operation occurs in parallel and the order of completion is not guaranteed. The <code>async</code> option to <code>$.ajax()</code> defaults to <code>true</code>, indicating that code execution can continue after the request is made. Setting this option to <code>false</code> (and thus making the call no longer asynchronous) is strongly discouraged, as it can cause the browser to become unresponsive.</p>
    <p>The <code>$.ajax()</code> function returns the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object that it creates. Normally jQuery handles the creation of this object internally, but a custom function for manufacturing one can be specified using the <code>xhr</code> option. The returned object can generally be discarded, but does provide a lower-level interface for observing and manipulating the request. In particular, calling <code>.abort()</code> on the object will halt the request before it completes.</p>

    <h4 id="extending-ajax">Extending Ajax</h4>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, jQuery's Ajax implementation includes <a href="/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/">prefilters</a>, <a href="/jQuery.ajaxTransport/">transports</a>, and converters that allow you to extend Ajax with a great deal of flexibility.</p>

    <h4 id="using-converters">Using Converters</h4>
    <p><code>$.ajax()</code> converters support mapping data types to other data types. If, however, you want to map a custom data type to a known type (e.g <code>json</code>), you must add a correspondance between the response Content-Type and the actual data type using the <code>contents</code> option:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxSetup({
  contents: {
    mycustomtype: /mycustomtype/
  },
  converters: {
    "mycustomtype json": function( result ) {
      // Do stuff
      return newresult;
    }
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This extra object is necessary because the response Content-Types and data types never have a strict one-to-one correspondance (hence the regular expression).</p>
    <p>To convert from a supported type (e.g <code>text</code>, <code>json</code>) to a custom data type and back again, use another pass-through converter:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxSetup({
  contents: {
    mycustomtype: /mycustomtype/
  },
  converters: {
    "text mycustomtype": true,
    "mycustomtype json": function( result ) {
      // Do stuff
      return newresult;
    }
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above now allows passing from <code>text</code> to <code>mycustomtype</code> and then <code>mycustomtype</code> to <code>json</code>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the <a title="Same Origin Policy on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, port, or protocol.

    <p>A typical prefilter registration using <code>$.ajaxPrefilter()</code> looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxPrefilter(function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {
  // Modify options, control originalOptions, store jqXHR, etc
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>options</code> are the request options</li>
      <li><code>originalOptions</code> are the options as provided to the ajax method, unmodified and, thus, without defaults from <code>ajaxSettings</code></li>
      <li><code>jqXHR</code> is the jqXHR object of the request</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prefilters are a perfect fit when custom options need to be handled.  Given the following code, for example, a call to <code>$.ajax()</code> would automatically abort a request to the same URL if the custom <code>abortOnRetry</code> option is set to <code>true</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
var currentRequests = {};

$.ajaxPrefilter(function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {
  if ( options.abortOnRetry ) {
    if ( currentRequests[ options.url ] ) {
      currentRequests[ options.url ].abort();
    }
    currentRequests[ options.url ] = jqXHR;
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Prefilters can also be used to modify existing options. For example, the following proxies cross-domain requests through http://mydomain.net/proxy/:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxPrefilter(function( options ) {
  if ( options.crossDomain ) {
    options.url = "http://mydomain.net/proxy/" + encodeURIComponent( options.url );
    options.crossDomain = false;
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>If the optional <code>dataTypes</code> argument is supplied, the prefilter will be only be applied to requests with the indicated dataTypes. For example, the following only applies the given prefilter to JSON and script requests:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxPrefilter( "json script", function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {
  // Modify options, control originalOptions, store jqXHR, etc
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>$.ajaxPrefilter()</code> method can also redirect a request to another dataType by returning that dataType. For example, the following sets a request as "script" if the URL has some specific properties defined in a custom <code>isActuallyScript()</code> function:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxPrefilter(function( options ) {
  if ( isActuallyScript( options.url ) ) {
    return "script";
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This would ensure not only that the request is considered "script" but also that all the prefilters specifically attached to the script dataType would be applied to it.</p>

    <p>A transport is an object that provides two methods, <code>send</code> and <code>abort</code>, that are used internally by <code>$.ajax()</code> to issue requests. A transport is the most advanced way to enhance <code>$.ajax()</code> and should be used only as a last resort when prefilters and converters are insufficient.</p>
    <p>Since each request requires its own transport object instance, transports cannot be registered directly. Therefore, you should provide a function that returns a transport instead.</p>
    <p>Transports factories are registered using <code>$.ajaxTransport()</code>. A typical registration looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxTransport( dataType, function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {
  if( /* transportCanHandleRequest */ ) {
    return {
      send: function( headers, completeCallback ) {
        // Send code
      },
      abort: function() {
        // Abort code
      }
    };
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>options</code> are the request options</li>
      <li><code>originalOptions</code> are the options as provided to the ajax method, unmodified and, thus, without defaults from ajaxSettings</li>
      <li><code>jqXHR</code> is the jqXHR object of the request</li>
      <li><code>headers</code> is an object of (key-value) request headers that the transport can transmit if it supports it</li>
      <li><code>completeCallback</code> is the callback used to notify ajax of the completion of the request</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code>completeCallback</code> has the following signature:</p>
    <pre><code>
function( status, statusText, responses, headers ) {}
    </code></pre>
    <p>where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>status</code> is the HTTP status code of the response, like  200 for a typical success, or 404 for when the resource is not found.</li>
      <li><code>statusText</code> is the statusText of the response.</li>
      <li><code>responses</code> (Optional) is An object containing dataType/value that contains the response in all the formats the transport could provide (for instance, a native XMLHttpRequest object would set reponses to <code>{ xml: XMLData, text: textData }</code> for a response that is an XML document)</li>
      <li><code>headers</code> (Optional) is a string containing all the response headers if the transport has access to them (akin to what <code>XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders()</code> would provide).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just like prefilters, a transport's factory function can be attached to a specific dataType:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxTransport( "script", function( options, originalOptions, jqXHR ) {
  // Will only be called for script requests
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>The following example shows how a minimal image transport could be implemented:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxTransport( "image", function( s ) {
  if ( s.type === "GET" &amp;&amp; s.async ) {
    var image;
    return {
      send: function( _ , callback ) {
        image = new Image();
        function done( status ) {
          if ( image ) {
            var statusText = ( status === 200 ) ? "success" : "error",
              tmp = image;
            image = image.onreadystatechange = image.onerror = image.onload = null;
            callback( status, statusText, { image: tmp } );
          }
        }
        image.onreadystatechange = image.onload = function() {
          done( 200 );
        };
        image.onerror = function() {
          done( 404 );
        };
        image.src = s.url;
      },
      abort: function() {
        if ( image ) {
          image = image.onreadystatechange = image.onerror = image.onload = null;
        }
      }
    };
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="handling-custom-data-types">Handling Custom Data Types</h4>
    <p>The jQuery Ajax implementation comes with a set of standard dataTypes, such as text, json, xml, and html.</p>
    <p>Use the <code>converters</code> option in <code><a href="/jQuery.ajaxSetup/">$.ajaxSetup()</a></code> to augment or modify the data type conversion strategies used by <code>$.ajax()</code>.</p>
    <p> The unminified jQuery source itself includes a list of default converters, which effectively illustrates how they can be used: </p>
    <pre><code>
// List of data converters
// 1) Key format is "source_type destination_type"
//    (a single space in-between)
// 2) The catchall symbol "*" can be used for source_type
converters: {
  // Convert anything to text
  "* text": window.String,
  // Text to html (true = no transformation)
  "text html": true,
  // Evaluate text as a json expression
  "text json": jQuery.parseJSON,
  // Parse text as xml
  "text xml": jQuery.parseXML
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>When you specify a <code>converters</code> option globally in <code>$.ajaxSetup()</code> or per call in <code>$.ajax()</code>, the object will map onto the default converters, overwriting those you specify and leaving the others intact.</p>
    <p>For example, the jQuery source uses <code>$.ajaxSetup()</code> to  add a converter for "text script":</p>
    <pre><code>
jQuery.ajaxSetup({
  accepts: {
    script: "text/javascript, application/javascript"
  },
  contents: {
    script: /javascript/
  },
  converters: {
    "text script": jQuery.globalEval

      <p>This property is available immediately. It is therefore safe to use it to determine whether or not to call <code>$(document).ready()</code>.
    The <code>$.browser</code> property is deprecated in jQuery 1.3, and its functionality may be moved to a team-supported plugin in a future release of jQuery.</p>
      <p>Because <code>$.browser</code> uses <code>navigator.userAgent</code> to determine the platform, it is vulnerable to spoofing by the user or misrepresentation by the browser itself. It is always best to avoid browser-specific code entirely where possible. Instead of relying on <code>$.browser</code> it's better to use libraries like <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>.</p>

  </signature>
  <desc>Hook directly into jQuery to override how particular CSS properties are retrieved or set, normalize CSS property naming, or create custom properties.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>$.cssHooks</code> object provides a way to define functions for getting and setting particular CSS values. It can also be used to create new cssHooks for normalizing CSS3 features such as box shadows and gradients. </p>
    <p>For example, some versions of Webkit-based browsers require <code>-webkit-border-radius</code> to set the <code>border-radius</code> on an element, while earlier Firefox versions require <code>-moz-border-radius</code>. A css hook can normalize these vendor-prefixed properties to let <code>.css()</code> accept a single, standard property name (<code>border-radius</code>, or with DOM property syntax, <code>borderRadius</code>).</p>
    <p>In addition to providing fine-grained control over how specific style properties are handled, <code>$.cssHooks</code> also extends the set of properties available to the <code>.animate()</code> method.</p>
    <p>Defining a new css hook is straight-forward. The skeleton template below can serve as a guide to creating your own. </p>
    <pre><code>
(function( $ ) {

// First, check to see if cssHooks are supported
if ( !$.cssHooks ) {
  // If not, output an error message
  throw( new Error( "jQuery 1.4.3 or above is required for this plugin to work" ) );
}

// Wrap in a document ready call, because jQuery writes
// cssHooks at this time and will blow away your functions
// if they exist.
$(function () {
  $.cssHooks[ "someCSSProp" ] = {
    get: function( elem, computed, extra ) {
      // Handle getting the CSS property
    },
    set: function( elem, value ) {
      // Handle setting the CSS value
    }
  };
});

})( jQuery );
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="feature-testing">Feature Testing</h4>
    <p>Before normalizing a vendor-specific CSS property, first determine whether the browser supports the standard property or a vendor-prefixed variation. For example, to check for support of the <code>border-radius</code> property, see if any variation is a member of a temporary element's <code>style</code> object.</p>
    <pre><code>
(function( $ ) {

function styleSupport( prop ) {
  var vendorProp, supportedProp,

    // Capitalize first character of the prop to test vendor prefix
    capProp = prop.charAt( 0 ).toUpperCase() + prop.slice( 1 ),
    prefixes = [ "Moz", "Webkit", "O", "ms" ],
    div = document.createElement( "div" );

  if ( prop in div.style ) {

    // Browser supports standard CSS property name
    supportedProp = prop;
  } else {

    // Otherwise test support for vendor-prefixed property names
    for ( var i = 0; i &lt; prefixes.length; i++ ) {
      vendorProp = prefixes[ i ] + capProp;
      if ( vendorProp in div.style ) {
        supportedProp = vendorProp;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  // Avoid memory leak in IE
  div = null;

  // Add property to $.support so it can be accessed elsewhere
  $.support[ prop ] = supportedProp;
  return supportedProp;
}

// Call the function, e.g. testing for "border-radius" support:
styleSupport( "borderRadius" );

})( jQuery );
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="defining-complete-csshook">Defining a complete css hook</h4>
    <p>To define a complete css hook, combine the support test with a filled-out version of the skeleton template provided in the first example:</p>
    <pre><code>
(function( $ ) {

if ( !$.cssHooks ) {
  throw( new Error( "jQuery 1.4.3+ is needed for this plugin to work" ) );
}

function styleSupport( prop ) {
  var vendorProp, supportedProp,
    capProp = prop.charAt( 0 ).toUpperCase() + prop.slice( 1 ),
    prefixes = [ "Moz", "Webkit", "O", "ms" ],
    div = document.createElement( "div" );

  if ( prop in div.style ) {
    supportedProp = prop;
  } else {
    for ( var i = 0; i &lt; prefixes.length; i++ ) {
      vendorProp = prefixes[ i ] + capProp;
      if ( vendorProp in div.style ) {
        supportedProp = vendorProp;
        break;
      }
    }
  }

  div = null;
  $.support[ prop ] = supportedProp;
  return supportedProp;
}

var borderRadius = styleSupport( "borderRadius" );

// Set cssHooks only for browsers that support a vendor-prefixed border radius
if ( borderRadius &amp;&amp; borderRadius !== "borderRadius" ) {
  $.cssHooks.borderRadius = {
    get: function( elem, computed, extra ) {
      return $.css( elem, borderRadius );
    },
    set: function( elem, value) {
      elem.style[ borderRadius ] = value;
    }
  };
}

})( jQuery );
    </code></pre>
    <p>You can then set the border radius in a supported browser using either the DOM (camelCased) style or the CSS (hyphenated) style:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#element" ).css( "borderRadius", "10px" );
$( "#another" ).css( "border-radius", "20px" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>If the browser lacks support for any form of the CSS property, vendor-prefixed or not, the style is not applied to the element. However, if the browser supports a proprietary alternative, it can be applied to the cssHooks instead. </p>
    <pre><code>
(function( $ ) {

// Feature test for support of a CSS property
// and a proprietary alternative
// ...
if ( $.support.someCSSProp &amp;&amp; $.support.someCSSProp !== "someCSSProp" ) {

  // Set cssHooks for browsers that
  // support only a vendor-prefixed someCSSProp
  $.cssHooks.someCSSProp = {
    get: function( elem, computed, extra ) {
      return $.css( elem, $.support.someCSSProp );
    },
    set: function( elem, value) {
      elem.style[ $.support.someCSSProp ] = value;
    }
  };
} else if ( supportsProprietaryAlternative ) {
  $.cssHooks.someCSSProp = {
    get: function( elem, computed, extra ) {
      // Handle crazy conversion from the proprietary alternative
    },
    set: function( elem, value ) {
      // Handle crazy conversion to the proprietary alternative
    }
  }
}

})( jQuery );
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="special-units">Special units</h4>
    <p>By default, jQuery adds a "px" unit to the values passed to the <code>.css()</code> method. This behavior can be prevented by adding the property to the <code>jQuery.cssNumber</code> object</p>
    <pre><code>
$.cssNumber.someCSSProp = true;
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="animating">Animating with cssHooks</h4>
    <p>A css hook can also hook into jQuery's animation mechanism by adding a property to the <code>jQuery.fx.step</code> object:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.fx.step.someCSSProp = function( fx ) {
  $.cssHooks.someCSSProp.set( fx.elem, fx.now + fx.unit );
};
    </code></pre>
    <p>Note that this works best for simple numeric-value animations. More custom code may be required depending on the CSS property, the type of value it returns, and the animation's complexity.</p>

    <p>The <code>$.each()</code> function is not the same as <a href="/each/">$(selector).each()</a>, which is used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object. The <code>$.each()</code> function can be used to iterate over any collection, whether it is an object or an array. In the case of an array, the callback is passed an array index and a corresponding array value each time. (The value can also be accessed through the <code>this</code> keyword, but Javascript will always wrap the <code>this</code> value as an <code>Object</code> even if it is a simple string or number value.) The method returns its first argument, the object that was iterated.</p>

  <desc>Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>When two or more object arguments are supplied to <code>$.extend()</code>, properties from all of the objects are added to the target object. Arguments that are <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> are ignored.</p>
    <p>If only one argument is supplied to <code>$.extend()</code>, this means the target argument was omitted. In this case, the jQuery object itself is assumed to be the target. By doing this, you can add new functions to the jQuery namespace. This can be useful for plugin authors wishing to add new methods to JQuery.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the target object (first argument) will be modified, and will also be returned from <code>$.extend()</code>. If, however, you want to preserve both of the original objects, you can do so by passing an empty object as the target:</p>
    <pre><code>var object = $.extend({}, object1, object2);</code></pre>
    <p>The merge performed by <code>$.extend()</code> is not recursive by default; if a property of the first object is itself an object or array, it will be completely overwritten by a property with the same key in the second or subsequent object. The values are not merged. This can be seen in the example below by examining the value of banana. However, by passing <code>true</code> for the first function argument, objects will be recursively merged.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Passing <code>false</code> for the first argument is not supported.</p>
    <p>Undefined properties are not copied. However, properties inherited from the object's prototype <em>will</em> be copied over. Properties that are an object constructed via <code>new MyCustomObject(args)</code>, or built-in JavaScript types such as Date or RegExp, are not re-constructed and will appear as plain Objects in the resulting object or array.</p>
    <p>On a <code>deep</code> extend, Object and Array are extended, but object wrappers on primitive types such as String, Boolean, and Number are not. Deep-extending a cyclical data structure will result in an error.</p>
    <p>For needs that fall outside of this behavior, write a custom extend method instead, or use a library like <a href="http://lodash.com">lodash</a>. </p>

    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return  a superset of the <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code> object. This jQuery XHR object, or "jqXHR," returned by <code>$.get()</code> implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a> for more information). The <code>jqXHR.done()</code> (for success), <code>jqXHR.fail()</code> (for error), and <code>jqXHR.always()</code> (for completion, whether success or error) methods take a function argument that is called when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the <a href="/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR Object</a> section of the $.ajax() documentation.</p>
    <p>The Promise interface also allows jQuery's Ajax methods, including <code>$.get()</code>, to chain multiple <code>.done()</code>, <code>.fail()</code>, and <code>.always()</code> callbacks on a single request, and even to assign these callbacks after the request may have completed. If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.</p>
    <pre><code>
// Assign handlers immediately after making the request,
// and remember the jqxhr object for this request
var jqxhr = $.get( "example.php", function() {
  alert( "success" );
})
  .done(function() {
    alert( "second success" );
  })
  .fail(function() {
    alert( "error" );
  })
  .always(function() {
    alert( "finished" );
  });

// Perform other work here ...

// Set another completion function for the request above
jqxhr.always(function() {
  alert( "second finished" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <h4>Deprecation Notice</h4>
    <p>The <code>jqXHR.success()</code>, <code>jqXHR.error()</code>, and <code>jqXHR.complete()</code> callback methods introduced in jQuery 1.5 are <strong>deprecated as of jQuery 1.8</strong>. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use <code>jqXHR.done()</code>, <code>jqXHR.fail()</code>, and <code>jqXHR.always()</code> instead.</p>

  <note>
			Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the <a title="Same Origin Policy on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, port, or protocol.
		</note>
  <note>
			If a request with jQuery.get() returns an error code, it will fail silently unless the script has also called the global <a href="/ajaxError/">.ajaxError() </a> method. Alternatively, as of jQuery 1.5, the <code>.error()</code> method of the <code>jqXHR</code> object returned by jQuery.get() is also available for error handling.

For example, all strings represented in JSON, whether they are properties or values, must be enclosed in double-quotes. For details on the JSON format, see <a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a>.</p>

If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.</p>
    <pre><code>
// Assign handlers immediately after making the request,
// and remember the jqxhr object for this request
var jqxhr = $.getJSON( "example.json", function() {
  console.log( "success" );
})
  .done(function() {
    console.log( "second success" );
  })
  .fail(function() {
    console.log( "error" );
  })
  .always(function() {
    console.log( "complete" );
  });

// Perform other work here ...

// Set another completion function for the request above
jqxhr.complete(function() {
  console.log( "second complete" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <h4>Deprecation Notice</h4>
    <p>The <code>jqXHR.success()</code>, <code>jqXHR.error()</code>, and <code>jqXHR.complete()</code> callback methods introduced in jQuery 1.5 are <strong>deprecated as of jQuery 1.8</strong>. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use <code>jqXHR.done()</code>, <code>jqXHR.fail()</code>, and <code>jqXHR.always()</code> instead.</p>

    <p>Prior to jQuery 1.5, the global <code>.ajaxError()</code> callback event had to be used in order to handle <code>$.getScript()</code> errors:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "div.log" ).ajaxError(function( e, jqxhr, settings, exception ) {

});
    </code></pre>
    <h4 id="caching-requests">Caching Responses</h4>
    <p>By default, <code>$.getScript()</code> sets the cache setting to <code>false</code>. This appends a timestamped query parameter to the request URL to ensure that the browser downloads the script each time it is requested. You can override this feature by setting the cache property globally using <a href="/jquery.ajaxsetup/"><code>$.ajaxSetup()</code></a>: </p>
    <pre><code>
$.ajaxSetup({
  cache: true
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Alternatively, you could define a new method that uses the more flexible <code>$.ajax()</code> method.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Define a $.cachedScript() method that allows fetching a cached script:</desc>
    <code>
jQuery.cachedScript = function( url, options ) {

  // Allow user to set any option except for dataType, cache, and url
  options = $.extend( options || {}, {
    dataType: "script",
    cache: true,
    url: url
  });

  // Use $.ajax() since it is more flexible than $.getScript
  // Return the jqXHR object so we can chain callbacks
  return jQuery.ajax( options );
};

// Usage
$.cachedScript( "ajax/test.js" ).done(function( script, textStatus ) {
  console.log( textStatus );

    <p>The <code>jQuery.hasData()</code> method provides a way to determine if an element currently has any values that were set using <code><a href="/jQuery.data/">jQuery.data()</a></code>. If no data is associated with an element (there is no data object at all or the data object is empty), the method returns <code>false</code>; otherwise it returns <code>true</code>.</p>
    <p>The primary advantage of <code>jQuery.hasData(element)</code> is that it does not create and associate a data object with the element if none currently exists. In contrast, <code>jQuery.data(element)</code> always returns a data object to the caller, creating one if no data object previously existed.
</p>
    <p>Note that jQuery's event system uses the jQuery data API to store event handlers. Therefore, binding an event to an element using <code>.on()</code>, <code>.bind()</code>, <code>.live()</code>, <code>.delegate()</code>, or one of the shorthand event methods also associates a data object with that element.

  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>$.holdReady()</code> method allows the caller to delay jQuery's ready event. This <em>advanced feature</em> would typically be used by dynamic script loaders that want to load additional JavaScript such as jQuery plugins before allowing the ready event to occur, even though the DOM may be ready. This method must be called early in the document, such as in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> immediately after the jQuery script tag. Calling this method after the ready event has already fired will have no effect. </p>
    <p>To delay the ready event, first call <code>$.holdReady( true )</code>. When the ready event should be released to execute, call <code>$.holdReady( false )</code>. Note that multiple holds can be put on the ready event, one for each <code>$.holdReady( true )</code> call. The ready event will not actually fire until all holds have been released with a corresponding number of <code>$.holdReady( false )</code> calls <em>and</em> the normal document ready conditions are met. (See <a href="/ready/"><code>ready</code></a> for more information.)</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Host objects (or objects used by browser host environments to complete the execution environment of ECMAScript) have a number of inconsistencies which are difficult to robustly feature detect cross-platform.

    <p>which throws an invalid pointer exception in IE8. With this in mind, it's important to be aware of any of the gotchas involved in using <code>$.isPlainObject()</code> against older browsers. A couple basic examples that do function correctly cross-browser can be found below.</p>

    <p>If you wish to process a jQuery object — for example, <code>$('div').map( callback );</code> — use <a href="/map/">.map()</a> instead. </p>
    <p>The <code>$.map()</code> method applies a function to each item in an array or object and maps the results into a new array. <strong>Prior to jQuery 1.6</strong>, <code>$.map()</code> supports traversing <em>arrays only</em>. <strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong> it also traverses objects.</p>
    <p>Array-like objects — those with a <code>.length</code> property <em>and</em> a value on the <code>.length - 1</code> index — must be converted to actual arrays before being passed to <code>$.map()</code>. The jQuery library provides <a href="/jQuery.makeArray/">$.makeArray()</a> for such conversions.</p>
    <pre><code>
// The following object masquerades as an array.
var fakeArray = { "length": 2, 0: "Addy", 1: "Subtracty" };

// Therefore, convert it to a real array
var realArray = $.makeArray( fakeArray )

// Now it can be used reliably with $.map()
$.map( realArray, function( val, i ) {
  // Do something
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>The translation function that is provided to this method is called for each top-level element in the array or object and is passed two arguments: The element's value and its index or key within the array or object.</p>
    <p>The function can return:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the translated value, which will be mapped to the resulting array</li>

  <desc>Relinquish jQuery's control of the <code>$</code> variable.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Many JavaScript libraries use <code>$</code> as a function or variable name, just as jQuery does. In jQuery's case, <code>$</code> is just an alias for <code>jQuery</code>, so all functionality is available without using <code>$</code>. If you need to use another JavaScript library alongside jQuery, return control of <code>$</code> back to the other library with a call to <code>$.noConflict()</code>. Old references of <code>$</code> are saved during jQuery initialization; <code>noConflict()</code> simply restores them.</p>
    <p>If for some reason two versions of jQuery are loaded (which is not recommended), calling <code>$.noConflict( true )</code> from the second version will return the globally scoped jQuery variables to those of the first version.</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;script src="other_lib.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
$.noConflict();
// Code that uses other library's $ can follow here.
&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>This technique is especially effective in conjunction with the <code>.ready()</code> method's ability to alias the jQuery object, as within callback passed to <code>.ready()</code> you can use <code>$</code> if you wish without fear of conflicts later:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;script src="other_lib.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

  // Code that uses jQuery's $ can follow here.
});
// Code that uses other library's $ can follow here.
&lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If necessary, you can free up the <code>jQuery</code> name as well by passing <code>true</code> as an argument to the method. This is rarely necessary, and if you must do this (for example, if you need to use multiple versions of the jQuery library on the same page), you need to consider that most plug-ins rely on the presence of the <code>jQuery</code> variable and may not operate correctly in this situation.</p>

    <p>As of jQuery 1.3, the return value of a function is used instead of the function as a String.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4, the <code>$.param()</code> method serializes deep objects recursively to accommodate modern scripting languages and frameworks such as PHP and Ruby on Rails. You can disable this functionality globally by setting <code>jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional = true;</code>.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.8, the <code>$.param()</code> method no longer uses <code>jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional</code> as its default setting and will default to <code>false</code>. For best compatibility across versions, call <code>$.param()</code> with an explicit value for the second argument and do not use defaults.</p>

    </code></pre>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because some frameworks have limited ability to parse serialized arrays, developers should exercise caution when passing an <code>obj</code> argument that contains objects or arrays nested within another array.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Because there is no universally agreed-upon specification for param strings, it is not possible to encode complex data structures using this method in a manner that works ideally across all languages supporting such input. Use JSON format as an alternative for encoding complex data instead.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In jQuery 1.4, HTML5 input elements are also serialized.</p>
    <p>We can display a query string representation of an object and a URI-decoded version of the same as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
var myObject = {
  a: {
    one: 1,
    two: 2,
    three: 3
  },
  b: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
};
var recursiveEncoded = $.param( myObject );
var recursiveDecoded = decodeURIComponent( $.param( myObject ) );

alert( recursiveEncoded );
alert( recursiveDecoded );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The values of <code>recursiveEncoded</code> and <code>recursiveDecoded</code> are alerted as follows:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>a%5Bone%5D=1&amp;a%5Btwo%5D=2&amp;a%5Bthree%5D=3&amp;b%5B%5D=1&amp;b%5B%5D=2&amp;b%5B%5D=3</samp>

    <p><code>jQuery.parseHTML</code> uses a native DOM element creation function to convert the string to a set of DOM elements, which can then be inserted into the document.</p>
    <p>By default, the <code>context</code> is the current <code>document</code> if not specified or given as <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>. If the HTML was to be used in another document such as an iframe, that frame's document could be used.</p>
	<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
	<p>Most jQuery APIs that accept HTML strings will run scripts that are included in the HTML. <code>jQuery.parseHTML</code> does not run script in the parsed HTML unless <code>keepScripts</code> is explicitly <code>true</code>. However, it is still possible in most environments to execute script indirectly, for example via the <code>&lt;img onerror&gt;</code> attribute. The caller should be aware of this and guard against it by cleaning or escaping any untrusted inputs from sources such as the URL or cookies. For future compatibility, callers should not depend on the ability to run <em>any</em> script content when <code>keepScripts</code> is unspecified or <code>false</code>.</p>

    <p>Passing in a malformed JSON string results in a JavaScript exception being thrown. For example, the following are all malformed JSON strings:</p>

      <li><code>{test: 1}</code> (test does not have double quotes around it).</li>

    <p>The JSON standard does not permit "control characters" such as a tab or newline. An example like <code>$.parseJSON( '{ "testing":"1\t2\n3" }' )</code> will throw an error in most implementations because the JavaScript parser converts the string's tab and newline escapes into literal tab and newline; doubling the backslashes like <code>"1\\t2\\n3"</code> yields expected results. This problem is often seen when injecting JSON into a JavaScript file from a server-side language such as PHP.</p>

    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>success</code> callback function is passed the returned data, which will be an XML root element or a text string depending on the MIME type of the response. It is also passed the text status of the response.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, the <code>success</code> callback function is also passed a <a href="#jqxhr-object">"jqXHR" object</a> (in <strong>jQuery 1.4</strong>, it was passed the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object).</p>
    <p>Most implementations will specify a success handler:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.post( "ajax/test.html", function( data ) {
  $( ".result" ).html( data );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This example fetches the requested HTML snippet and inserts it on the page.</p>
    <p>Pages fetched with <code>POST</code> are never cached, so the <code>cache</code> and <code>ifModified</code> options in <code><a href="/jQuery.ajaxSetup/">jQuery.ajaxSetup()</a></code> have no effect on these requests.</p>
    <h4 id="jqxhr-object">The jqXHR Object</h4>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.5</strong>, all of jQuery's Ajax methods return  a superset of the <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code> object. This jQuery XHR object, or "jqXHR," returned by <code>$.get()</code> implements the Promise interface, giving it all the properties, methods, and behavior of a Promise (see <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a> for more information). The <code>jqXHR.done()</code> (for success), <code>jqXHR.fail()</code> (for error), and <code>jqXHR.always()</code> (for completion, whether success or error) methods take a function argument that is called when the request terminates. For information about the arguments this function receives, see the <a href="/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR">jqXHR Object</a> section of the $.ajax() documentation.</p>
        <p>The Promise interface also allows jQuery's Ajax methods, including <code>$.get()</code>, to chain multiple <code>.done()</code>, <code>.fail()</code>, and <code>.always()</code> callbacks on a single request, and even to assign these callbacks after the request may have completed. If the request is already complete, the callback is fired immediately.</p>
    <pre><code>
// Assign handlers immediately after making the request,
// and remember the jqxhr object for this request
var jqxhr = $.post( "example.php", function() {
  alert( "success" );
})
  .done(function() {
    alert( "second success" );
  })
  .fail(function() {
    alert( "error" );
  })
  .always(function() {
    alert( "finished" );
});

// Perform other work here ...

// Set another completion function for the request above
jqxhr.always(function() {
  alert( "second finished" );
});
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Deprecation Notice</h4>
    <p>The <code>jqXHR.success()</code>, <code>jqXHR.error()</code>, and <code>jqXHR.complete()</code> callback methods introduced in jQuery 1.5 are <strong>deprecated as of jQuery 1.8</strong>. To prepare your code for their eventual removal, use <code>jqXHR.done()</code>, <code>jqXHR.fail()</code>, and <code>jqXHR.always()</code> instead.</p>

  <note>
			Due to browser security restrictions, most "Ajax" requests are subject to the <a title="Same Origin Policy on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>; the request can not successfully retrieve data from a different domain, subdomain, port, or protocol.
		</note>
  <note>
			If a request with jQuery.post() returns an error code, it will fail silently unless the script has also called the global <a href="/ajaxError/">.ajaxError() </a> method. Alternatively, as of jQuery 1.5, the <code>.error()</code> method of the <code>jqXHR</code> object returned by jQuery.post() is also available for error handling.

  <longdesc>
    <p>This method is most useful for attaching event handlers to an element where the context is pointing back to a different object. Additionally, jQuery makes sure that even if you bind the function returned from <code>jQuery.proxy()</code> it will still unbind the correct function if passed the original.</p>
    <p>Be aware, however, that jQuery's event binding subsystem assigns a unique id to each event handling function in order to track it when it is used to specify the function to be unbound. The function represented by <code>jQuery.proxy()</code> is seen as a single function by the event subsystem, even when it is used to bind different contexts. To avoid unbinding the wrong handler, use a unique event namespace for binding and unbinding (e.g., <code>"click.myproxy1"</code>) rather than specifying the proxied function during unbinding.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, any number of additional arguments may be supplied to <code>$.proxy()</code>, and they will be passed to the function whose context will be changed.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.9</strong>, when the <code>context</code> is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code> the proxied function will be called with the same <code>this</code> object as the proxy was called with. This allows <code>$.proxy()</code> to be used to partially apply the arguments of a function without changing the context.</p>

      <p>Every element can have one or more queues of functions attached to it by jQuery. In most applications, only one queue (called <code>fx</code>) is used. Queues allow a sequence of actions to be called on an element asynchronously, without halting program execution.</p>

      <p>Note that when adding a function with <code>jQuery.queue()</code>, we should ensure that <code>jQuery.dequeue()</code> is eventually called so that the next function in line executes.</p>

  <desc>Creates a new copy of jQuery whose properties and methods can be modified without affecting the original jQuery object.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>
      <strong>This method is deprecated as of jQuery 1.7 and will be moved to a plugin in jQuery 1.8.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>There are two specific use cases for which jQuery.sub() was created. The first was for providing a painless way of overriding jQuery methods without completely destroying the original methods and another was for helping to do encapsulation and basic namespacing for jQuery plugins.</p>
    <p>Note that jQuery.sub() doesn't attempt to do any sort of isolation - that's not its intention. All the methods on the sub'd version of jQuery will still point to the original jQuery (events bound and triggered will still be through the main jQuery, data will be bound to elements through the main jQuery, Ajax queries and events will run through the main jQuery, etc.).</p>
    <p>Note that if you're looking to use this for plugin development you should first <i>strongly</i> consider using something like the jQuery UI widget factory which manages both state and plugin sub-methods. <a href="http://blog.nemikor.com/2010/05/15/building-stateful-jquery-plugins/">Some examples of using the jQuery UI widget factory</a> to build a plugin.</p>

    <argument name="deferreds" type="Deferred">
      <desc>One or more Deferred objects, or plain JavaScript objects.</desc>
    </argument>
  </signature>
  <desc>Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred</a> objects that represent asynchronous events.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>If a single Deferred is passed to <code>jQuery.when()</code>, its Promise object (a subset of the Deferred methods) is returned by the method. Additional methods of the Promise object can be called to attach callbacks, such as <a href="/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then</code></a>. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, usually by the code that created the Deferred originally, the appropriate callbacks will be called. For example, the jqXHR object returned by <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> is a Promise and can be used this way:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.when( $.ajax( "test.aspx" ) ).then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {
  alert( jqXHR.status ); // Alerts 200
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>If a single argument is passed to <code>jQuery.when()</code> and it is not a Deferred or a Promise, it will be treated as a resolved Deferred and any doneCallbacks attached will be executed immediately. The doneCallbacks are passed the original argument. In this case any failCallbacks you might set are never called since the Deferred is never rejected. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$.when( { testing: 123 } ).done(function( x ) {
  alert( x.testing ); // Alerts "123"
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the case where multiple Deferred objects are passed to <code>jQuery.when()</code>, the method returns the Promise from a new "master" Deferred object that tracks the aggregate state of all the Deferreds it has been passed. The method will resolve its master Deferred as soon as all the Deferreds resolve, or reject the master Deferred as soon as one of the Deferreds is rejected. If the master Deferred is resolved, the doneCallbacks for the master Deferred are executed. The arguments passed to the doneCallbacks provide the resolved values for each of the Deferreds, and matches the order the Deferreds were passed to <code>jQuery.when()</code>. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
var d1 = new $.Deferred();
var d2 = new $.Deferred();

$.when( d1, d2 ).done(function ( v1, v2 ) {
    console.log( v1 ); // "Fish"
    console.log( v2 ); // "Pizza"
});

d1.resolve( "Fish" );
d2.resolve( "Pizza" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the event a Deferred was resolved with no value, the corresponding doneCallback argument will be undefined. If a Deferred resolved to a single value, the corresponding argument will hold that value. In the case where a Deferred resolved to multiple values, the corresponding argument will be an array of those values. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
var d1 = new $.Deferred();
var d2 = new $.Deferred();
var d3 = new $.Deferred();

$.when( d1, d2, d3 ).done(function ( v1, v2, v3 ) {
    console.log( v1 ); // v1 is undefined
    console.log( v2 ); // v2 is "abc"
    console.log( v3 ); // v3 is an array [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
});

d1.resolve();
d2.resolve( "abc" );
d3.resolve( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the multiple-Deferreds case where one of the Deferreds is rejected, <code>jQuery.when()</code> immediately fires the failCallbacks for its master Deferred. Note that some of the Deferreds may still be unresolved at that point. The arguments passed to the failCallbacks match the signature of the failCallback for the Deferred that was rejected. If you need to perform additional processing for this case, such as canceling any unfinished ajax requests, you can keep references to the underlying jqXHR objects in a closure and inspect/cancel them in the failCallback.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Execute a function after two ajax requests are successful. (See the jQuery.ajax() documentation for a complete description of success and error cases for an ajax request).</desc>
    <code>
$.when( $.ajax( "/page1.php" ), $.ajax( "/page2.php" ) ).done(function( a1, a2 ) {
  // a1 and a2 are arguments resolved for the page1 and page2 ajax requests, respectively.
  // Each argument is an array with the following structure: [ data, statusText, jqXHR ]
  var data = a1[ 0 ] + a2[ 0 ]; // a1[ 0 ] = "Whip", a2[ 0 ] = " It"
  if ( /Whip It/.test( data ) ) {
    alert( "We got what we came for!" );
  }
});

    <desc>Execute the function <code>myFunc</code> when both ajax requests are successful, or <code>myFailure</code> if either one has an error.</desc>

    <desc>Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements.</desc>
    <longdesc>
      <p>In the first formulation listed above,  <code>jQuery()</code> — which can also be written as <code>$()</code> — searches through the DOM for any elements that match the provided selector and creates a new jQuery object that references these elements:</p>
      <pre><code>$( "div.foo" );</code></pre>
      <p>If no elements match the provided selector, the new jQuery object is "empty"; that is, it contains no elements and has <code><a href="/length/">.length</a></code> property of 0.</p>
      <h4 id="selector-context">Selector Context</h4>
      <p>By default, selectors perform their searches within the DOM starting at the document root. However, an alternate context can be given for the search by using the optional second parameter to the <code>$()</code> function. For example, to do a search within an event handler, the search can be restricted like so:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div.foo" ).click(function() {
  $( "span", this ).addClass( "bar" );
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>When the search for the span selector is restricted to the context of <code>this</code>, only spans within the clicked element will get the additional class.</p>
      <p>Internally, selector context is implemented with the <code>.find()</code> method, so  <code>$( "span", this )</code> is equivalent to  <code>$( this ).find( "span" )</code>.</p>

      <h4 id="using-dom-elements">Using DOM elements</h4>
      <p>The second and third formulations of this function create a jQuery object using one or more DOM elements that were already selected in some other way. When passing an array, each element <em>must</em> be a DOM element; mixed data is not supported. A jQuery object is created from the array elements in the order they appeared in the array; unlike most other multi-element jQuery operations, the elements are not sorted in DOM order.</p>
      <p>A common use of single-DOM-element construction is to call jQuery methods on an element that has been passed to a callback function through the keyword <code>this</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "div.foo" ).click(function() {
  $( this ).slideUp();
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>This example causes elements to be hidden with a sliding animation when clicked. Because the handler receives the clicked item in the <code>this</code> keyword as a bare DOM element, the element must be passed to the <code>$()</code> function before applying jQuery methods to it.</p>
      <p>XML data returned from an Ajax call can be passed to the <code>$()</code> function so individual elements of the XML structure can be retrieved using <code>.find()</code> and other DOM traversal methods.</p>
      <pre><code>
$.post( "url.xml", function( data ) {
  var $child = $( data ).find( "child" );
});
      </code></pre>

      <h4 id="cloning-jquery-objects">Cloning jQuery Objects</h4>
      <p>When a jQuery object is passed to the <code>$()</code> function, a clone of the object is created. This new jQuery object references the same DOM elements as the initial one.</p>

      <h4 id="returning-empty-set">Returning an Empty Set</h4>
      <p>As of jQuery 1.4, calling the <code>jQuery()</code> method with <em>no arguments</em> returns an empty jQuery set (with a <code><a href="/length/">.length</a></code> property of 0). In previous versions of jQuery, this would return a set containing the document node.</p>
      <h4 id="working-with-plain-objects">Working With Plain Objects</h4>
      <p>At present, the only operations supported on plain JavaScript objects wrapped in jQuery are: <code>.data()</code>,<code>.prop()</code>,<code>.on()</code>, <code>.off()</code>, <code>.trigger()</code> and <code>.triggerHandler()</code>. The use of <code>.data()</code> (or any method requiring <code>.data()</code>) on a plain object will result in a new property on the object called jQuery{randomNumber} (eg. jQuery123456789).</p>
      <pre><code>
// Define a plain object
var foo = { foo: "bar", hello: "world" };

// Pass it to the jQuery function
var $foo = $( foo );

// Test accessing property values
var test1 = $foo.prop( "foo" ); // bar

// Test setting property values
$foo.prop( "foo", "foobar" );
var test2 = $foo.prop( "foo" ); // foobar

// Test using .data() as summarized above
$foo.data( "keyName", "someValue" );
console.log( $foo ); // will now contain a jQuery{randomNumber} property

// Test binding an event name and triggering
$foo.on( "eventName", function () {
  console.log( "eventName was called" );
});

$foo.trigger( "eventName" ); // Logs "eventName was called"
      </code></pre>
      <p>Should <code>.trigger( "eventName" )</code> be used, it will search for an "eventName" property on the object and attempt to execute it after any attached jQuery handlers are executed. It does not check whether the property is a function or not. To avoid this behavior, <code>.triggerHandler( "eventName" )</code> should be used instead.</p>
      <pre><code>
$foo.triggerHandler( "eventName" ); // Also logs "eventName was called"
      </code></pre>

    <longdesc>
      <h4 id="creating-new-elements">Creating New Elements</h4>
      <p>If a string is passed as the parameter to <code>$()</code>, jQuery examines the string to see if it looks like HTML (i.e., it starts with <code>&lt;tag ... &gt;</code>). If not, the string is interpreted as a selector expression, as explained above. But if the string appears to be an HTML snippet, jQuery attempts to create new DOM elements as described by the HTML. Then a jQuery object is created and returned that refers to these elements. You can perform any of the usual jQuery methods on this object:</p>
      <pre><code>$( "&lt;p id='test'&gt;My &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; text&lt;/p&gt;" ).appendTo( "body" );</code></pre>
      <p>For explicit parsing of a string to HTML, use the <a href="/jQuery.parseHTML/">$.parseHTML()</a> method.</p>
      <p>By default, elements are created with an <code>.ownerDocument</code> matching the document into which the jQuery library was loaded. Elements being injected into a different document should be created using that document, e.g., <code>$("&lt;p&gt;hello iframe&lt;/p&gt;", $("#myiframe").prop("contentWindow").document)</code>.</p>
      <p>If the HTML is more complex than a single tag without attributes, as it is in the above example, the actual creation of the elements is handled by the browser's <code>.innerHTML</code> mechanism. In most cases, jQuery creates a new &lt;div&gt; element and sets the innerHTML property of the element to the HTML snippet that was passed in. When the parameter has a single tag (with optional closing tag or quick-closing) — <code>$( "&lt;img /&gt;" )</code> or <code>$( "&lt;img&gt;" )</code>, <code>$( "&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" )</code> or <code>$( "&lt;a&gt;" )</code> — jQuery creates the element using the native JavaScript <code>.createElement()</code> function.</p>
      <p>When passing in complex HTML, some browsers may not generate a DOM that exactly replicates the HTML source provided. As mentioned, jQuery uses the browser's <code>.innerHTML</code> property to parse the passed HTML and insert it into the current document. During this process, some browsers filter out certain elements such as <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements. As a result, the elements inserted may not be representative of the original string passed.</p>
      <p>Filtering isn't, however, limited to these tags. For example, Internet Explorer prior to version 8 will also convert all <code>href</code> properties on links to absolute URLs, and Internet Explorer prior to version 9 will not correctly handle HTML5 elements without the addition of a separate <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/">compatibility layer</a>.</p>
      <p>To ensure cross-platform compatibility, the snippet must be well-formed. Tags that can contain other elements should be paired with a closing tag:</p>
      <pre><code>$( "&lt;a href='http://jquery.com'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" );</code></pre>
      <p>Tags that cannot contain elements may be quick-closed or not:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "&lt;img&gt;" );
$( "&lt;input&gt;" );
      </code></pre>
      <p>When passing HTML to <code>jQuery()</code>, note that text nodes are not treated as DOM elements. With the exception of a few methods (such as <code>.content()</code>), they are generally ignored or removed. E.g:</p>
      <pre><code>
var el = $( "&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;3" ); // returns [&lt;br&gt;, "2", &lt;br&gt;]
el = $( "&lt;br&gt;2&lt;br&gt;3 &gt;" ); // returns [&lt;br&gt;, "2", &lt;br&gt;, "3 &amp;gt;"]
      </code></pre>
      <p>This behavior is expected. <strong>As of jQuery 1.9.0</strong> (and unless using the <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/#readme">jQuery Migrate plugin</a>), <code>jQuery()</code> requires the HTML string to start with a <code>&lt;</code> (i.e text nodes cannot appear at the front of the HTML string).</p>
      <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4</strong>, the second argument to <code>jQuery()</code> can accept a plain object consisting of a superset of the properties that can be passed to the <a href="/attr/">.attr()</a> method.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> If the second argument is passed, the HTML string in the first argument must represent a simple element with no attributes. <strong>As of jQuery 1.4</strong>, any <a href="/category/events/">event type</a> can be passed in, and the following jQuery methods can be called: <a href="/val/">val</a>, <a href="/css/">css</a>, <a href="/html/">html</a>, <a href="/text/">text</a>, <a href="/data/">data</a>, <a href="/width/">width</a>, <a href="/height/">height</a>, or <a href="/offset/">offset</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.8</strong>, any jQuery instance method (a method of <code>jQuery.fn</code>) can be used as a property of the object passed to the second parameter:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "<div/>", {
  "class": "my-div",
  on: {
    touchstart: function( event ) {
      // Do something
    }
  }
}).appendTo( "body" );
      </code></pre>
      <p>The name <code>"class"</code> must be quoted in the object since it is a JavaScript reserved word, and <code>"className"</code> cannot be used since it refers to the DOM property, not the attribute. </p>
      <p>While the second argument is convenient, its flexibility can lead to unintended consequences (e.g. <code>$( "&lt;input&gt;", {size: "4"} )</code> calling the <code>.size()</code> method instead of setting the size attribute). The previous code block could thus be written instead as:</p>
<pre><code>
$( "<div/>" )
  .addClass( "my-div" )
  .on({
    touchstart: function( event ) {
      // Do something
    }
  })
    .appendTo( "body" );

  <desc>Bind an event handler to the "keydown" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "keydown", handler )</code> in the first and second variations, and <code>.trigger( "keydown" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>keydown</code> event is sent to an element when the user first presses a key on the keyboard. It can be attached to any element, but the event is only sent to the element that has the focus. Focusable elements can vary between browsers, but form elements can always get focus so are reasonable candidates for this event type.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input id="target" type="text" value="Hello there"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the input field:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).keydown(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .keydown() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the insertion point is inside the field, pressing a key displays the alert:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .keydown() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.keydown()</code> without an argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).keydown();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>If key presses anywhere need to be caught (for example, to implement global shortcut keys on a page), it is useful to attach this behavior to the <code>document</code> object. Because of event bubbling, all key presses will make their way up the DOM to the <code>document</code> object unless explicitly stopped.</p>
    <p>To determine which key was pressed, examine the <a href="/category/events/event-object/">event object</a> that is passed to the handler function. While browsers use differing properties to store this information, jQuery normalizes the <code>.which</code> property so you can reliably use it to retrieve the key code. This code corresponds to a key on the keyboard, including codes for special keys such as arrows. For catching actual text entry, <code>.keypress()</code> may be a better choice.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> as the <code>keypress</code> event isn't covered by any official specification, the actual behavior encountered when using it may differ across browsers, browser versions, and platforms.</p>
    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "keypress", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "keypress" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>keypress</code> event is sent to an element when the browser registers keyboard input. This is similar to the <code>keydown</code> event, except that modifier and non-printing keys such as <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd>, and <kbd>delete</kbd> trigger <code>keydown</code> events but not <code>keypress</code> events. Other differences between the two events may arise depending on platform and browser.</p>
    <p>A <code>keypress</code> event handler can be attached to any element, but the event is only sent to the element that has the focus. Focusable elements can vary between browsers, but form controls can always get focus so are reasonable candidates for this event type.</p>

    <p>Now when the insertion point is inside the field, pressing a key displays the log:</p>

    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.keypress()</code> without an argument:</p>

    <p>If key presses anywhere need to be caught (for example, to implement global shortcut keys on a page), it is useful to attach this behavior to the <code>document</code> object. Because of event bubbling, all key presses will make their way up the DOM to the <code>document</code> object unless explicitly stopped.</p>
    <p>To determine which character was entered, examine the <code>event</code> object that is passed to the handler function. While browsers use differing properties to store this information, jQuery normalizes the <code>.which</code> property so you can reliably use it to retrieve the character code.</p>
    <p>Note that <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> provide a code indicating which key is pressed, while <code>keypress</code> indicates which character was entered. For example, a lowercase "a" will be reported as 65 by <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code>, but as 97 by <code>keypress</code>. An uppercase "A" is reported as 65 by all events. Because of this distinction, when catching special keystrokes such as arrow keys, <code>.keydown()</code> or <code>.keyup()</code> is a better choice.</p>

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "keyup", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "keyup" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>keyup</code> event is sent to an element when the user releases a key on the keyboard. It can be attached to any element, but the event is only sent to the element that has the focus. Focusable elements can vary between browsers, but form elements can always get focus so are reasonable candidates for this event type.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input id="target" type="text" value="Hello there"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the input field:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).keyup(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .keyup() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the insertion point is inside the field and a key is pressed and released, the alert is displayed:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .keyup() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.keyup()</code> without arguments:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).keyup();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>

    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.7</strong>, the <code>.live()</code> method is deprecated. Use <a href="/on/"><code>.on()</code></a> to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use <a href="/delegate/"><code>.delegate()</code></a> in preference to <code>.live()</code>.</p>
    <p>This method provides a means to attach delegated event handlers to the <code>document</code> element of a page, which simplifies the use of event handlers when content is dynamically added to a page. See the discussion of direct versus delegated events in the <a href="/on/"><code>.on()</code></a> method for more information. </p>
    <p>Rewriting the <code>.live()</code> method in terms of its successors is straightforward; these are templates for equivalent calls for all three event attachment methods:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( selector ).live( events, data, handler );                // jQuery 1.3+
$( document ).delegate( selector, events, data, handler );  // jQuery 1.4.3+
$( document ).on( events, selector, data, handler );        // jQuery 1.7+
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>events</code> argument can either be a space-separated list of event type names and optional namespaces, or an object of event name strings and handlers. The <code>data</code> argument is optional and can be omitted. For example, the following three method calls are functionally equivalent (but see below for more effective and performant ways to attach delegated event handlers):</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "a.offsite" ).live( "click", function() {
  alert( "Goodbye!" ); // jQuery 1.3+
});
$( document ).delegate( "a.offsite", "click", function() {
  alert( "Goodbye!" ); // jQuery 1.4.3+
});
$( document ).on( "click", "a.offsite", function() {
  alert( "Goodbye!" );  // jQuery 1.7+
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Use of the <code>.live()</code> method is no longer recommended since later versions of jQuery offer better methods that do not have its drawbacks. In particular, the following issues arise with the use of <code>.live()</code>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>jQuery attempts to retrieve the elements specified by the selector before calling the <code>.live()</code> method, which may be time-consuming on large documents.</li>
      <li>Chaining methods is not supported. For example, <code>$( "a" ).find( ".offsite, .external" ).live( ... ); </code> is <em>not</em> valid and does not work as expected.</li>
      <li>Since all <code>.live()</code> events are attached at the <code>document</code> element, events take the longest and slowest possible path before they are handled.</li>
      <li>On mobile iOS (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) the <code>click</code> event does not bubble to the document body for most elements and cannot be used with <code>.live()</code> without applying one of the following workarounds:
        <ol>
          <li>Use natively clickable elements such as <code>a</code> or <code>button</code>, as both of these do bubble to <code>document</code>.</li>
          <li>Use <code>.on()</code> or <code>.delegate()</code> attached to an element below the level of <code>document.body</code>, since mobile iOS does bubble within the body.</li>
          <li>Apply the CSS style <code>cursor:pointer</code> to the element that needs to bubble clicks (or a parent including <code>document.documentElement</code>). Note however, this will disable copy\paste on the element and cause it to be highlighted when touched.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Calling <a href="/event.stopPropagation/"><code>event.stopPropagation()</code></a> in the event handler is ineffective in stopping event handlers attached lower in the document; the event has already propagated to <code>document</code>.</li>
      <li>The <code>.live()</code> method interacts with other event methods in ways that can be surprising, e.g., <code>$( document ).off( "click" )</code> removes all click handlers attached by any call to <code>.live()</code>!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For pages still using <code>.live()</code>, this list of version-specific differences may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before jQuery 1.7, to stop further handlers from executing after one bound using <code>.live()</code>, the handler must return <code>false</code>. Calling <code>.stopPropagation()</code> will not accomplish this.</li>
      <li>As of <b>jQuery 1.4</b> the <code>.live()</code> method supports custom events as well as <em>all JavaScript events that bubble</em>. It also supports certain events that don't bubble, including <code>change</code>, <code>submit</code>, <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code>.</li>
      <li>In <b>jQuery 1.3.x</b> only the following JavaScript events could be bound: <code>click</code>, <code>dblclick</code>, <code>keydown</code>, <code>keypress</code>, <code>keyup</code>, <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseover</code>, and <code>mouseup</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "load", handler )</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>load</code> event is sent to an element when it and all sub-elements have been completely loaded. This event can be sent to any element associated with a URL: images, scripts, frames, iframes, and the <code>window</code> object.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a page with a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;img src="book.png" alt="Book" id="book"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the image:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#book" ).load(function() {
  // Handler for .load() called.
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>As soon as the image has been loaded, the handler is called.</p>
    <p>In general, it is not necessary to wait for all images to be fully loaded. If code can be executed earlier, it is usually best to place it in a handler sent to the <code>.ready()</code> method.

        <b>Caveats of the <code>load</code> event when used with images</b>
        <p>A common challenge developers attempt to solve using the <code>.load()</code> shortcut is to execute a function when an image (or collection of images) have completely loaded. There are several known caveats with this that should be noted. These are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It doesn't work consistently nor reliably cross-browser</li>
          <li>It doesn't fire correctly in WebKit if the image src is set to the same src as before</li>
          <li>It doesn't correctly bubble up the DOM tree</li>
          <li>Can cease to fire for images that already live in the browser's cache</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>.live()</code> and <code>.delegate()</code> methods cannot be used to detect the <code>load</code> event of an iframe. The load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn't set by Firefox, IE9 or Chrome, which is required to do event delegation.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Note: The event handling suite also has a method named <code><a href="/load-event/">.load()</a></code>. jQuery determines which method to fire based on the set of arguments passed to it.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This method is the simplest way to fetch data from the server. It is roughly equivalent to <code>$.get(url, data, success)</code> except that it is a method rather than global function and it has an implicit callback function.  When a successful response is detected (i.e. when <code>textStatus</code> is "success" or "notmodified"), <code>.load()</code> sets the HTML contents of the matched element to the returned data. This means that most uses of the method can be quite simple:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>If no element is matched by the selector — in this case, if the document does not contain an element with id="result" — the Ajax request will <em>not</em> be sent.</p>
    <h4 id="callback-function">Callback Function</h4>
    <p>If a "complete" callback is provided, it is executed after post-processing and HTML insertion has been performed. The callback is fired once for each element in the jQuery collection, and <code>this</code> is set to each DOM element in turn.</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html", function() {
  alert( "Load was performed." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>In the two examples above, if the current document does not contain an element with an ID of "result," the <code>.load()</code> method is not executed.</p>
    <h4 id="request-method">Request Method</h4>
    <p>The POST method is used if data is provided as an object; otherwise, GET is assumed.</p>
    <h4 id="loading-page-fragments">Loading Page Fragments</h4>
    <p>The <code>.load()</code> method, unlike <code><a href="/jQuery.get/">$.get()</a></code>, allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the <code>url</code> parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded.   </p>
    <p>We could modify the example above to use only part of the document that is fetched:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>When this method executes, it retrieves the content of <code>ajax/test.html</code>, but then jQuery parses the returned document to find the element with an ID of <code>container</code>. This element, along with its contents, is inserted into the element with an ID of <code>result</code>, and the rest of the retrieved document is discarded.</p>
    <p>jQuery uses the browser's <code>.innerHTML</code> property to parse the retrieved document and insert it into the current document. During this process, browsers often filter elements from the document such as <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> elements. As a result, the elements retrieved by <code>.load()</code> may not be exactly the same as if the document were retrieved directly by the browser.</p>
    <h4 id="script-execution">Script Execution</h4>
    <p> When calling <code>.load()</code> using a URL without a suffixed selector expression, the content is passed to <code>.html()</code> prior to scripts being removed. This executes the script blocks before they are discarded. If <code>.load()</code> is called with a selector expression appended to the URL, however, the scripts are stripped out prior to the DOM being updated, and thus are <em>not</em> executed. An example of both cases can be seen below:</p>
    <p>Here, any JavaScript loaded into <code>#a</code> as a part of the document will successfully execute.</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#a" ).load( "article.html" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>However, in the following case, script blocks in the document being loaded into <code>#b</code> are stripped out and not executed:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#b" ).load( "article.html #target" );
    </code></pre>

    <p>The index-related selectors (including this "less than" selector) filter the set of elements that have matched the expressions that precede them. They narrow the set down based on the order of the elements within this matched set. For example, if elements are first selected with a class selector (<code>.myclass</code>) and four elements are returned, these elements are given indices 0 through 3 for the purposes of these selectors.</p>
    <p>Note that since JavaScript arrays use <em>0-based indexing</em>, these selectors reflect that fact. This is why <code>$( ".myclass:lt(1)" )</code> selects the first element in the document with the class <code>myclass</code>, rather than selecting no elements. In contrast, <code>:nth-child(n)</code> uses <em>1-based indexing</em> to conform to the CSS specification.</p>
    <p>Prior to jQuery 1.8, the <code>:lt(index)</code> selector did <em>not</em> accept a negative value for <code>index</code></p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:lt()</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:lt()</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. For better performance in modern browsers, use <code>$("your-pure-css-selector").slice(0, index)</code> instead.

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "mousedown", handler)</code> in the first variation, and <code>.trigger( "mousedown" )</code> in the second.</p>
    <p>The <code>mousedown</code> event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is pressed. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;div id="target"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/0042_05_01.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).mousedown(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .mousedown() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now if we click on this element, the alert is displayed:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .mousedown() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>We can also trigger the event when a different element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).mousedown();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>The <code>mousedown</code> event is sent when any mouse button is clicked. To act only on specific buttons, we can use the event object's <code>which </code>property. Not all browsers support this property (Internet Explorer uses button instead), but jQuery normalizes the property so that it is safe to use in any browser. The value of <code>which</code> will be 1 for the left button, 2 for the middle button, or 3 for the right button.</p>
    <p>This event is primarily useful for ensuring that the primary button was used to begin a drag operation; if ignored, strange results can occur when the user attempts to use a context menu. While the middle and right buttons can be detected with these properties, this is not reliable. In Opera and Safari, for example, right mouse button clicks are not detectable by default.</p>
    <p>If the user clicks on an element, drags away from it, and releases the button, this is still counted as a <code>mousedown</code> event. This sequence of actions is treated as a "canceling" of the button press in most user interfaces, so it is usually better to use the <code>click</code> event unless we know that the <code>mousedown</code> event is preferable for a particular situation.</p>

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "mouseenter", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "mouseenter" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>mouseenter</code> JavaScript event is proprietary to Internet Explorer. Because of the event's general utility, jQuery simulates this event so that it can be used regardless of browser. This event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer enters the element. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="outer"&gt;
  Outer
  &lt;div id="inner"&gt;
    Inner
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="log"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/0042_05_08.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to any element:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#outer" ).mouseenter(function() {
  $( "#log" ).append( "&lt;div&gt;Handler for .mouseenter() called.&lt;/div&gt;" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the mouse pointer moves over the <samp>Outer</samp> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, the message is appended to <code>&lt;div id="log"&gt;</code>. You can also trigger the event when another element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#outer" ).mouseenter();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also append the message.</p>
    <p>The <code>mouseenter</code> event differs from <code>mouseover</code> in the way it handles event bubbling. If <code>mouseover</code> were used in this example, then when the mouse pointer moved over the <samp>Inner</samp> element, the handler would be triggered. This is usually undesirable behavior. The <code>mouseenter</code> event, on the other hand, only triggers its handler when the mouse enters the element it is bound to, not a descendant. So in this example, the handler is triggered when the mouse enters the <samp>Outer</samp> element, but not the <samp>Inner</samp> element.</p>

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "mousemove", handler )</code> in the first two variations, and <code>.trigger( "mousemove" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>mousemove</code> event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer moves inside the element. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="target"&gt;
  Move here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="log"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the target:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).mousemove(function( event ) {
  var msg = "Handler for .mousemove() called at ";
  msg += event.pageX + ", " + event.pageY;
  $( "#log" ).append( "&lt;div&gt;" + msg + "&lt;/div&gt;" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the mouse pointer moves within the target button, the messages are appended to &lt;div id="log"&gt;:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .mousemove() called at (399, 48)</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>Handler for .mousemove() called at (398, 46)</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>Handler for .mousemove() called at (397, 44)</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>Handler for .mousemove() called at (396, 42)</samp>
      <br/>
    </p>
    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.mousemove()</code> without an argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).mousemove();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on the Trigger button will also append the message:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .mousemove() called at (undefined, undefined)</samp>
    </p>
    <p>When tracking mouse movement, you usually need to know the actual position of the mouse pointer. The event object that is passed to the handler contains some information about the mouse coordinates. Properties such as <code>.clientX</code>, <code>.offsetX</code>, and <code>.pageX</code> are available, but support for them differs between browsers. Fortunately, jQuery normalizes the <code>.pageX</code> and <code>.pageY</code> properties so that they can be used in all browsers. These properties provide the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the document, as illustrated in the example output above.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the <code>mousemove</code> event is triggered whenever the mouse pointer moves, even for a pixel. This means that hundreds of events can be generated over a very small amount of time. If the handler has to do any significant processing, or if multiple handlers for the event exist, this can be a serious performance drain on the browser. It is important, therefore, to optimize <code>mousemove </code>handlers as much as possible, and to unbind them as soon as they are no longer needed.</p>
    <p>A common pattern is to bind the <code>mousemove</code> handler from within a <code>mousedown</code> hander, and to unbind it from a corresponding <code>mouseup</code> handler. If implementing this sequence of events, remember that the <code>mouseup</code> event might be sent to a different HTML element than the <code>mousemove</code> event was. To account for this, the <code>mouseup</code> handler should typically be bound to an element high up in the DOM tree, such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>

$( "#outer" ).mouseover(function() {
  $( "#log" ).append( "&lt;div&gt;Handler for .mouseover() called.&lt;/div&gt;" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the mouse pointer moves over the <samp>Outer</samp> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, the message is appended to <code>&lt;div id="log"&gt;</code>. We can also trigger the event when another element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#outer" ).mouseover();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also append the message.</p>
    <p>This event type can cause many headaches due to event bubbling. For instance, when the mouse pointer moves over the <samp>Inner</samp> element in this example, a <code>mouseover</code> event will be sent to that, then trickle up to <samp>Outer</samp>. This can trigger our bound <code>mouseover</code> handler at inopportune times. See the discussion for <code>.mouseenter()</code> for a useful alternative.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Show the number of times mouseover and mouseenter events are triggered.
<code>mouseover</code> fires when the pointer moves into the child element as well, while <code>mouseenter</code> fires only when the pointer moves into the bound element.</desc>

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on('mouseup', handler)</code> in the first variation, and <code>.trigger('mouseup')</code> in the second.</p>
    <p>The <code>mouseup</code> event is sent to an element when the mouse pointer is over the element, and the mouse button is released. Any HTML element can receive this event.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="target"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/0042_05_02.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to any <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).mouseup(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .mouseup() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now if we click on this element, the alert is displayed:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .mouseup() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>We can also trigger the event when a different element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).mouseup();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also alert the message.</p>
    <p>If the user clicks outside an element, drags onto it, and releases the button, this is still counted as a <code>mouseup</code> event. This sequence of actions is not treated as a button press in most user interfaces, so it is usually better to use the <code>click</code> event unless we know that the <code>mouseup</code> event is preferable for a particular situation.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Show texts when mouseup and mousedown event triggering.</desc>

  <desc>Remove elements from the set of matched elements.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.not()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements. The supplied selector is tested against each element; the elements that don't match the selector will be included in the result.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can apply this method to the set of list items:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).not( ":even" ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background for items 2 and 4, as they do not match the selector (recall that :even and :odd use 0-based indexing).</p>
    <h4>Removing Specific Elements</h4>
    <p>The second version of the <code>.not()</code> method allows us to remove elements from the matched set, assuming we have found those elements previously by some other means. For example, suppose our list had an id applied to one of its items:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li id="notli"&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can fetch the third list item using the native JavaScript <code>getElementById()</code> function, then remove it from a jQuery object:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).not( document.getElementById( "notli" ) )
  .css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This statement changes the color of items 1, 2, 4, and 5. We could have accomplished the same thing with a simpler jQuery expression, but this technique can be useful when, for example, other libraries provide references to plain DOM nodes.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4, the <code>.not()</code> method can take a function as its argument in the same way that <code>.filter()</code> does. Elements for which the function returns <code>true</code> are excluded from the filtered set; all other elements are included.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Adds a border to divs that are not green or blue.</desc>
    <code>
$( "div" ).not( ".green, #blueone" )
  .css( "border-color", "red" );

    <added>1.1.4</added>
    <argument name="index" type="Number/String">
      <desc>The index of each child to match, starting with <code>1</code>, the string <code>even</code> or <code>odd</code>, or an equation ( eg. <code>:nth-child(even)</code>, <code>:nth-child(4n)</code> )</desc>
    </argument>
  </signature>
  <desc>Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Because jQuery's implementation of <code>:nth-</code> selectors is strictly derived from the CSS specification, the value of <code>n</code> is "1-indexed", meaning that the counting starts at 1. For other selector expressions such as <code>:eq()</code> or <code>:even</code> jQuery follows JavaScript's "0-indexed" counting. Given a single <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> containing two <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s, <code>$( "li:nth-child(1)" )</code> selects the first <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> while  <code>$( "li:eq(1)" )</code> selects the second.</p>
    <p>The <code>:nth-child(n)</code> pseudo-class is easily confused with <code>:eq(n)</code>, even though the two can result in dramatically different matched elements. With <code>:nth-child(n)</code>, all children are counted, regardless of what they are, and the specified element is selected only if it matches the selector attached to the pseudo-class. With <code>:eq(n)</code> only the selector attached to the pseudo-class is counted, not limited to children of any other element, and the (n+1)th one (n is 0-based) is selected.</p>
    <p>Further discussion of this unusual usage can be found in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo">W3C CSS specification</a>.</p>

Notice that this is different from the :even and :odd which have no regard for parent and just filter the list of elements to every other one.  The :nth-child, however, counts the index of the child to its particular parent.  In any case, it's easier to see than explain so...</desc>

    <p>The <code>.off()</code> method removes event handlers that were attached with <a href="/on/"><code>.on()</code></a>. See the discussion of delegated and directly bound events on that page for more information. Calling <code>.off()</code> with no arguments removes all handlers attached to the elements. Specific event handlers can be removed on elements by providing combinations of event names, namespaces, selectors, or handler function names. <strong>When multiple filtering arguments are given, all of the arguments provided must match for the event handler to be removed.</strong></p>
    <p>If a simple event name such as <code>"click"</code> is provided, <em>all</em> events of that type (both direct and delegated) are removed from the elements in the jQuery set. When writing code that will be used as a plugin, or simply when working with a large code base, best practice is to attach and remove events using namespaces so that the code will not inadvertently remove event handlers attached by other code. All events of all types in a specific namespace can be removed from an element by providing just a namespace, such as <code>".myPlugin"</code>. At minimum, either a namespace or event name must be provided.</p>
    <p>To remove specific delegated event handlers, provide a <code>selector</code> argument. The selector string must exactly match the one passed to <code>.on()</code> when the event handler was attached. To remove all delegated events from an element without removing non-delegated events, use the special value <code>"**"</code>.</p>
    <p>A handler can also be removed by specifying the function name in the <code>handler</code> argument. When jQuery attaches an event handler, it assigns a unique id to the handler function. Handlers proxied by <a href="/jQuery.proxy/"><code>jQuery.proxy()</code></a> or a similar mechanism will all have the same unique id (the proxy function), so passing proxied handlers to <code>.off</code> may remove more handlers than intended. In those situations it is better to attach and remove event handlers using namespaces.</p>
    <p>As with <code>.on()</code>, you can pass <code>events</code> as an object instead of specifying an <code>events</code> string and <code>handler</code> function as separate arguments. The keys for the <code>events</code> object are events and/or namespaces; the values are handler functions or the special value <code>false</code>.</p>

  <desc>Get the closest ancestor element that is positioned.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.offsetParent()</code> method allows us to search through the ancestors of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object wrapped around the closest positioned ancestor. An element is said to be positioned if it has a CSS position attribute of <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, or <code>fixed</code>. This information is useful for calculating offsets for performing animations and placing objects on the page.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a basic nested list on it, with a positioned element:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul class="level-1"&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-i"&gt;I&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-ii" style="position: relative;"&gt;II
    &lt;ul class="level-2"&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-a"&gt;A&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-b"&gt;B
        &lt;ul class="level-3"&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-1"&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-2"&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li class="item-3"&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class="item-c"&gt;C&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="item-iii"&gt;III&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we begin at item A, we can find its positioned ancestor:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li.item-a" ).offsetParent().css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>

    <p>The <code>.on()</code> method attaches event handlers to the currently selected set of elements in the jQuery object. As of jQuery 1.7, the <code>.on()</code> method provides all functionality required for attaching event handlers. For help in converting from older jQuery event methods, see <a href="/bind/"><code>.bind()</code></a>,  <a href="/delegate/"><code>.delegate()</code></a>, and <a href="/live/"><code>.live()</code></a>. To remove events bound with <code>.on()</code>, see <a href="/off/"><code>.off()</code></a>. To attach an event that runs only once and then removes itself, see <a href="/one/"><code>.one()</code></a></p>
    <h2 id="event-names">Event names and namespaces</h2>
    <p>Any event names can be used for the <code>events</code> argument. jQuery will pass through the browser's standard JavaScript event types, calling the <code>handler</code> function when the browser generates events due to user actions such as <code>click</code>. In addition, the <a href="/trigger/"><code>.trigger()</code></a> method can trigger both standard browser event names and custom event names to call attached handlers. Event names should only contain alphanumerics, underscore, and colon chraracters.</p>
    <p>An event name can be qualified by <em>event namespaces</em> that simplify removing or triggering the event. For example, <code>"click.myPlugin.simple"</code> defines both the myPlugin and simple namespaces for this particular click event. A click event handler attached via that string could be removed with <code>.off("click.myPlugin")</code> or <code>.off("click.simple")</code> without disturbing other click handlers attached to the elements. Namespaces are similar to CSS classes in that they are not hierarchical; only one name needs to match. Namespaces beginning with an underscore are reserved for jQuery's use.</p>
    <p>In the second form of <code>.on()</code>, the <code>events</code> argument is a plain object. The keys are strings in the same form as the <code>events</code> argument with space-separated event type names and optional namespaces. The value for each key is a function (or <code>false</code> value) that is used as the <code>handler</code> instead of the final argument to the method. In other respects, the two forms are identical in their behavior as described below.</p>
    <h2 id="direct-and-delegated-events">Direct and delegated events</h2>
    <p>The majority of browser events <em>bubble</em>, or <em>propagate</em>, from the deepest, innermost element (the <strong>event target</strong>) in the document where they occur all the way up to the body and the <code>document</code> element. In Internet Explorer 8 and lower, a few events such as <code>change</code> and <code>submit</code> do not natively bubble but jQuery patches these to bubble and create consistent cross-browser behavior.</p>
    <p>If <code>selector</code> is omitted or is null, the event handler is referred to as <em>direct</em> or <em>directly-bound</em>. The handler is called every time an event occurs on the selected elements, whether it occurs directly on the element or bubbles from a descendant (inner) element.</p>
    <p>When a <code>selector</code> is provided, the event handler is referred to as <em>delegated</em>. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector. jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector.</p>
    <p><strong>Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to <code>.on()</code>.</strong> To ensure the elements are present and can be selected, perform event binding inside a document ready handler for elements that are in the HTML markup on the page. If new HTML is being injected into the page, select the elements and attach event handlers <em>after</em> the new HTML is placed into the page. Or, use delegated events to attach an event handler, as described next.</p>
    <p>Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from <em>descendant elements</em> that are added to the document at a later time. By picking an element that is guaranteed to be present at the time the delegated event handler is attached, you can use delegated events to avoid the need to frequently attach and remove event handlers. This element could be the container element of a view in a Model-View-Controller design, for example, or <code>document</code> if the event handler wants to monitor all bubbling events in the document. The <code>document</code> element is available in the <code>head</code> of the document before loading any other HTML, so it is safe to attach events there without waiting for the document to be ready.</p>
    <p>In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored. On a data table with 1,000 rows in its <code>tbody</code>, this example attaches a handler to 1,000 elements:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#dataTable tbody tr" ).on( "click", function() {
  alert( $( this ).text() );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>A delegated-events approach attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked <code>tr</code> to <code>tbody</code>):</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#dataTable tbody" ).on( "click", "tr", function() {
  alert( $( this ).text() );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Delegated events do not work for SVG.</p>
    <h2 id="event-handler">The event handler and its environment</h2>
    <p>The <code>handler</code> argument is a function (or the value <code>false</code>, see below), and is required unless you pass an object for the <code>events</code> argument. You can provide an anonymous handler function at the point of the <code>.on()</code> call, as the examples have done above, or declare a named function and pass its name:</p>
    <pre><code>
function notify() {
  alert( "clicked" );
}
$( "button" ).on( "click", notify );
    </code></pre>
    <p>When the browser triggers an event or other JavaScript calls jQuery's <code>.trigger()</code> method, jQuery passes the handler an <a href="/category/events/event-object/"><code>event object</code></a> it can use to analyze and change the status of the event. This object is a <em>normalized subset</em> of data provided by the browser; the browser's unmodified native event object is available in <code>event.originalEvent</code>. For example, <a href="/event.type/"><code>event.type</code></a> contains the event name (e.g., "resize") and <a href="/event.target/"><code>event.target</code></a> indicates the deepest (innermost) element where the event occurred.</p>
    <p>By default, most events bubble up from the original event target to the <code>document</code> element. At each element along the way, jQuery calls any matching event handlers that have been attached. A handler can prevent the event from bubbling further up the document tree (and thus prevent handlers on those elements from running) by calling <code>event.stopPropagation()</code>. Any other handlers attached on the current element <em>will</em> run however. To prevent that, call <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</code>. (Event handlers bound to an element are called in the same order that they were bound.)</p>
    <p>Similarly, a handler can call <code>event.preventDefault()</code> to cancel any default action that the browser may have for this event; for example, the default action on a <code>click</code> event is to follow the link. Not all browser events have default actions, and not all default actions can be canceled. See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-types-list">W3C Events Specification</a> for details.</p>
    <p>Returning <code>false</code> from an event handler will automatically call <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> and <code>event.preventDefault()</code>. A <code>false</code> value can also be passed for the <code>handler</code> as a shorthand for <code>function(){ return false; }</code>. So, <code>$( "a.disabled" ).on( "click", false );</code> attaches an event handler to all links with class "disabled" that prevents them from being followed when they are clicked and also stops the event from bubbling. </p>
    <p>When jQuery calls a handler, the <code>this</code> keyword is a reference to the element where the event is being delivered; for directly bound events this is the element where the event was attached and for delegated events this is an element matching <code>selector</code>. (Note that <code>this</code> may not be equal to <code>event.target</code> if the event has bubbled from a descendant element.) To create a jQuery object from the element so that it can be used with jQuery methods, use <code>$( this )</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="passing-data">Passing data to the handler</h2>
    <p>If a <code>data</code> argument is provided to <code>.on()</code> and is not <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, it is passed to the handler in the <a href="/event.data/"><code>event.data</code></a> property each time an event is triggered. The <code>data</code> argument can be any type, but if a string is used the <code>selector</code> must either be provided or explicitly passed as <code>null</code> so that the data is not mistaken for a selector. Best practice is to use a plain object so that multiple values can be passed as properties.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4, the same event handler can be bound to an element multiple times. This is especially useful when the <code>event.data</code> feature is being used, or when other unique data resides in a closure around the event handler function. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
function greet( event ) {
  alert( "Hello " + event.data.name );
}
$( "button" ).on( "click", {
  name: "Karl"
}, greet );
$( "button" ).on( "click", {
  name: "Addy"
}, greet );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The above code will generate two different alerts when the button is clicked.</p>
    <p>As an alternative or in addition to the <code>data</code> argument provided to the <code>.on()</code> method, you can also pass data to an event handler using a second argument to <a href="/trigger/">.trigger()</a> or <a href="/triggerHandler/">.triggerHandler()</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="event-performance">Event performance</h2>
    <p>In most cases, an event such as <code>click</code> occurs infrequently and performance is not a significant concern. However, high frequency events such as <code>mousemove</code> or <code>scroll</code> can fire dozens of times per second, and in those cases it becomes more important to use events judiciously. Performance can be increased by reducing the amount of work done in the handler itself, caching information needed by the handler rather than recalculating it, or by rate-limiting the number of actual page updates using <code>setTimeout</code>.</p>
    <p>Attaching many delegated event handlers near the top of the document tree can degrade performance. Each time the event occurs, jQuery must compare all selectors of all attached events of that type to every element in the path from the event target up to the top of the document. For best performance, attach delegated events at a document location as close as possible to the target elements. Avoid excessive use of <code>document</code> or <code>document.body</code> for delegated events on large documents.</p>
    <p>jQuery can process simple selectors of the form <code>tag#id.class</code> very quickly when they are used to filter delegated events. So, <code>"#myForm"</code>, <code>"a.external"</code>, and <code>"button"</code> are all fast selectors. Delegated events that use more complex selectors, particularly hierarchical ones, can be several times slower--although they are still fast enough for most applications. Hierarchical selectors can often be avoided simply by attaching the handler to a more appropriate point in the document. For example, instead of <code>$( "body" ).on( "click", "#commentForm .addNew", addComment )</code> use <code>$( "#commentForm" ).on( "click", ".addNew", addComment )</code>.</p>
    <h2 id="additional-notes">Additional notes</h2>
    <p>There are shorthand methods for some events such as <a href="/click/"><code>.click()</code></a> that can be used to attach or trigger event handlers. For a complete list of shorthand methods, see the <a href="/category/events/">events category</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Deprecated in jQuery 1.8, removed in 1.9:</em> The name <code>"hover"</code> used as a shorthand for the string <code>"mouseenter mouseleave"</code>. It attaches a <em>single event handler</em> for those two events, and the handler must examine <code>event.type</code> to determine whether the event is <code>mouseenter</code> or <code>mouseleave</code>. Do not confuse the "hover" pseudo-event-name with the <a href="/hover/"><code>.hover()</code></a> method, which accepts <em>one or two</em> functions.</p>
    <p>jQuery's event system requires that a DOM element allow attaching data via a property on the element, so that events can be tracked and delivered. The <code>object</code>, <code>embed</code>, and <code>applet</code> elements cannot attach data, and therefore cannot have jQuery events bound to them.</p>
    <p>The <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> events are specified by the W3C to not bubble, but jQuery defines cross-browser <code>focusin</code> and <code>focusout</code> events that do bubble. When <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> are used to attach delegated event handlers, jQuery maps the names and delivers them as <code>focusin</code> and <code>focusout</code> respectively. For consistency and clarity, use the bubbling event type names.</p>
    <p>In all browsers, the <code>load</code>, <code>scroll</code>, and <code>error</code> events (e.g., on an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element) do not bubble. In Internet Explorer 8 and lower, the <code>paste</code> and <code>reset</code> events do not bubble. Such events are not supported for use with delegation, but they <em>can</em> be used when the event handler is directly attached to the element generating the event.</p>
    <p>The <code>error</code> event on the <code>window</code> object uses nonstandard arguments and return value conventions, so it is not supported by jQuery. Instead, assign a handler function directly to the <code>window.onerror</code> property.</p>

    <p>The  <code>.one()</code> method is identical to  <code>.on()</code>, except that the handler is unbound after its first invocation. For example:</p>

			The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including <code>.outerWidth()</code>, may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer. Also, dimensions may be incorrect when the page is zoomed by the user; browsers do not expose an API to detect this condition.

    <p>This is the inverse of <code>:empty</code>. </p>
    <p>One important thing to note regarding the use of <code>:parent</code> (and <code>:empty</code>) is that child nodes include text nodes.</p>
    <p>The W3C recommends that the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element have at least one child node, even if that child is merely text (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-P">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-P</a>). Some other elements, on the other hand, are empty (i.e. have no children) by definition:<code> &lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, for example.</p>
    <p>To obtain the parents or ancestors of an existing jQuery set, see the <code><a href="/parent/">.parent()</a></code> and <code><a href="/parents/">.parents()</a></code> methods.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:parent</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:parent</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. To achieve the best performance when using <code>:parent</code> to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use <a href="/filter/"><code>.filter(":parent")</code></a>.

    <p>The <code>.prepend()</code> method inserts the specified content as the first child of each element in the jQuery collection (To insert it as the <em>last</em> child, use <a href="/append/"><code>.append()</code></a>). </p>
    <p>The <code>.prepend()</code> and <code><a href="/prependTo/">.prependTo()</a></code> methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax—specifically, in the placement of the content and target. With <code>.prepend()</code>, the selector expression preceding the method is the container into which the content is inserted. With <code>.prependTo()</code>, on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container.</p>
    <p>Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;

    </code></pre>
    <p>Each <code>&lt;div class="inner"&gt;</code> element gets this new content:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Test&lt;/p&gt;
    Hello

    <p>You can also select an element on the page and insert it into another:</p>
    <pre><code>

    </code></pre>
    <p>If <em>a single element</em> selected this way is inserted into a single location elsewhere in the DOM, it will be moved into the target (<em>not cloned</em>):</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Greetings&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <p><strong>Important</strong>: If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target except for the last one.</p>
    <h4 id="additional-arguments">Additional Arguments</h4>
    <p>Similar to other content-adding methods such as <code><a href="/append/">.append()</a></code> and <code><a href="/before/">.before()</a></code>, <code>.prepend()</code> also supports passing in multiple arguments as input. Supported input includes DOM elements, jQuery objects, HTML strings, and arrays of DOM elements.</p>
    <p>For example, the following will insert two new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and an existing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as the first three child nodes of the body:</p>
    <pre><code>
var $newdiv1 = $( "&lt;div id='object1'/&gt;"),
  newdiv2 = document.createElement( "div" ),
  existingdiv1 = document.getElementById( "foo" );

$( "body" ).prepend( $newdiv1, [ newdiv2, existingdiv1 ] );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Since <code>.prepend()</code> can accept any number of additional arguments, the same result can be achieved by passing in the three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s as three separate arguments, like so: <code>$( "body" ).prepend( $newdiv1, newdiv2, existingdiv1 )</code>. The type and number of arguments will largely depend on how you collect the elements in your code.</p>

Do not use these methods to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

    <p>The <code><a href="/prepend/">.prepend()</a></code> and <code>.prependTo()</code> methods perform the same task.

With <code>.prependTo()</code>, on the other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container.</p>

      </div>
      <h4>Attributes vs. Properties</h4>
      <p>The difference between <em>attributes</em> and <em>properties</em> can be important in specific situations. <strong>Before jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code><a href="/attr/">.attr()</a></code> method sometimes took property values into account when retrieving some attributes, which could cause inconsistent behavior. <strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code>.prop()</code> method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while <code>.attr()</code> retrieves attributes.</p>
      <p>For example, <code>selectedIndex</code>, <code>tagName</code>, <code>nodeName</code>, <code>nodeType</code>, <code>ownerDocument</code>, <code>defaultChecked</code>, and <code>defaultSelected</code> should be retrieved and set with the <code>.prop()</code> method. Prior to jQuery 1.6, these properties were retrievable with the <code>.attr()</code> method, but this was not within the scope of <code>attr</code>. These do not have corresponding attributes and are only properties.</p>
      <p>Concerning boolean attributes, consider a DOM element defined by the HTML markup <code>&lt;input type="checkbox" checked="checked" /&gt;</code>, and assume it is in a JavaScript variable named <code>elem</code>:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>elem.checked</code>
          </th>
          <td><code>true</code> (Boolean) Will change with checkbox state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <code>$( elem ).prop( "checked" )</code>
          </th>

      <p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.4">W3C forms specification</a>, the <code>checked</code> attribute is a <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.3.4.2">boolean attribute</a></em>, which means the corresponding property is <strong>true</strong> if the attribute is present at all—even if, for example, the attribute has no value or is set to empty string value or even "false". This is true of all boolean attributes.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the most important concept to remember about the <code>checked</code> attribute is that it does not correspond to the <code>checked</code> property. The attribute actually corresponds to the <code>defaultChecked</code> property and should be used only to set the <em>initial</em> value of the checkbox. The <code>checked</code> attribute value does not change with the state of the checkbox, while the <code>checked</code> property does. Therefore, the cross-browser-compatible way to determine if a checkbox is checked is to use the property:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>if ( elem.checked )</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>if ( $( elem ).prop( "checked" ) )</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>if ( $( elem ).is( ":checked" ) )</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The same is true for other dynamic attributes, such as <code>selected</code> and <code>value</code>.</p>

    <note>
			In Internet Explorer prior to version 9, using <code><a href="/prop/">.prop()</a></code> to set a DOM element property to anything other than a simple primitive value (number, string, or boolean) can cause memory leaks if the property is not removed (using <a href="/removeProp/"><code>.removeProp()</code></a>) before the DOM element is removed from the document. To safely set values on DOM objects without memory leaks, use <a href="/data/"><code>.data()</code></a>.

      <p>The <code>.prop()</code> method is a convenient way to set the value of properties—especially when setting multiple properties, using values returned by a function, or setting values on multiple elements at once. It should be used when setting <code>selectedIndex</code>, <code>tagName</code>, <code>nodeName</code>, <code>nodeType</code>, <code>ownerDocument</code>, <code>defaultChecked</code>, or <code>defaultSelected</code>. Since jQuery 1.6, these properties can no longer be set with the <code>.attr()</code> method. They do not have corresponding attributes and are only properties.</p>
      <p>Properties generally affect the dynamic state of a DOM element without changing the serialized HTML attribute. Examples include the <code>value</code> property of input elements, the <code>disabled</code> property of inputs and buttons, or the <code>checked</code> property of a checkbox. The <code>.prop()</code> method should be used to set disabled and checked instead of the <code><a href="/attr/">.attr()</a></code> method. The <code><a href="/val/">.val()</a></code> method should be used for getting and setting value.</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "input" ).prop( "disabled", false );
$( "input" ).prop( "checked", true );
$( "input" ).val( "someValue" );
      </code></pre>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> the <code><a href="/removeProp/">.removeProp()</a></code> method should not be used to set these properties to false. Once a native property is removed, it cannot be added again. See <code><a href="/removeProp/">.removeProp()</a></code> for more information.</p>
      <h4 id="computed-prop-values">Computed property values</h4>
      <p>By using a function to set properties, you can compute the value based on other properties of the element. For example, to toggle all checkboxes based off their individual values:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "input[type='checkbox']" ).prop( "checked", function( i, val ) {
  return !val;
});
      </code></pre>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>If nothing is returned in the setter function (ie. <code>function( index, prop ){})</code>, or if <code>undefined</code> is returned, the current value is not changed. This is useful for selectively setting values only when certain criteria are met.</p>

    <longdesc>
      <p>Every element can have one to many queues of functions attached to it by jQuery. In most applications, only one queue (called <code>fx</code>) is used. Queues allow a sequence of actions to be called on an element asynchronously, without halting program execution. The typical example of this is calling multiple animation methods on an element. For example:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).slideUp().fadeIn();
      </code></pre>
      <p>When this statement is executed, the element begins its sliding animation immediately, but the fading transition is placed on the <code>fx</code> queue to be called only once the sliding transition is complete.</p>
      <p>The <code>.queue()</code> method allows us to directly manipulate this queue of functions. Calling <code>.queue()</code> with a callback is particularly useful; it allows us to place a new function at the end of the queue. The callback function is executed once for each element in the jQuery set.</p>
      <p>This feature is similar to providing a callback function with an animation method, but does not require the callback to be given at the time the animation is performed.</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).slideUp();
$( "#foo" ).queue(function() {
  alert( "Animation complete." );
  $( this ).dequeue();
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>This is equivalent to:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).slideUp(function() {
  alert( "Animation complete." );
});
      </code></pre>
      <p>Note that when adding a function with <code>.queue()</code>, we should ensure that <code>.dequeue()</code> is eventually called so that the next function in line executes.</p>
      <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4</strong>, the function that's called is passed another function as the first argument. When called, this automatically dequeues the next item and keeps the queue moving. We use it as follows:</p>
      <pre><code>
$( "#test" ).queue(function( next ) {
    // Do some stuff...
    next();
});

  <desc>Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded.</desc>

      <desc>A function to execute after the DOM is ready.</desc>
    </argument>
  </signature>
  <longdesc>
    <p>While JavaScript provides the <code>load</code> event for executing code when a page is rendered, this event does not get triggered until all assets such as images have been completely received. In most cases, the script can be run as soon as the DOM hierarchy has been fully constructed. The handler passed to <code>.ready()</code> is guaranteed to be executed after the DOM is ready, so this is usually the best place to attach all other event handlers and run other jQuery code.  When using scripts that rely on the value of CSS style properties, it's important to reference external stylesheets or embed style elements before referencing the scripts.</p>
    <p>In cases where code relies on loaded assets (for example, if the dimensions of an image are required), the code should be placed in a handler for the <code>load</code> event instead.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>The <code>.ready()</code> method is generally incompatible with the <code>&lt;body onload=""&gt;</code> attribute. If <code>load</code> must be used, either do not use <code>.ready()</code> or use jQuery's <code>.load()</code> method to attach <code>load</code> event handlers to the window or to more specific items, like images.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>All three of the following syntaxes are equivalent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>$( document ).ready( handler )</code>
      </li>
      <li><code>$().ready( handler )</code> (this is not recommended)</li>
      <li>
        <code>$( handler )</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is also <code>$(document).on( "ready", handler )</code>, <em>deprecated as of jQuery 1.8</em>. This behaves similarly to the ready method but if the ready event has already fired and you try to <code>.on( "ready" )</code> the bound handler will not be executed. Ready handlers bound this way are executed <em>after</em> any bound by the other three methods above.</p>
    <p>The <code>.ready()</code> method can only be called on a jQuery object matching the current document, so the selector can be omitted.</p>
    <p>The <code>.ready()</code> method is typically used with an anonymous function:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( document ).ready(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Which is equivalent to calling:</p>
    <pre><code>
$(function() {
  // Handler for .ready() called.
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>If <code>.ready()</code> is called after the DOM has been initialized, the new handler passed in will be executed immediately.</p>
    <h4>Aliasing the jQuery Namespace</h4>
    <p>When using another JavaScript library, we may wish to call <code><a href="/jQuery.noConflict/">$.noConflict()</a></code> to avoid namespace difficulties. When this function is called, the <code>$</code> shortcut is no longer available, forcing us to write <code>jQuery</code> each time we would normally write <code>$</code>. However, the handler passed to the <code>.ready()</code> method can take an argument, which is passed the global <code>jQuery</code> object. This means we can rename the object within the context of our <code>.ready()</code> handler without affecting other code:</p>
    <pre><code>
jQuery( document ).ready(function( $ ) {
  // Code using $ as usual goes here.
});
    </code></pre>

  <desc>Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Similar to <code><a href="/empty/">.empty()</a></code>, the <code>.remove()</code> method takes elements out of the DOM. Use <code>.remove()</code> when you want to remove the element itself, as well as everything inside it. In addition to the elements themselves, all bound events and jQuery data  associated with the elements are removed. To remove the elements without removing data and events, use <code><a href="/detach/">.detach()</a></code> instead.</p>
    <p>Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can target any element for removal:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".hello" ).remove();
    </code></pre>
    <p>This will result in a DOM structure with the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element deleted:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we had any number of nested elements inside <code>&lt;div class="hello"&gt;</code>, they would be removed, too. Other jQuery constructs such as data or event handlers are erased as well.</p>
    <p>We can also include a selector as an optional parameter. For example, we could rewrite the previous DOM removal code as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "div" ).remove( ".hello" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This would result in the same DOM structure:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>The <code>.removeAttr()</code> method uses the JavaScript <code>removeAttribute()</code> function, but it has the advantage of being able to be called directly on a jQuery object and it accounts for different attribute naming across browsers.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing an inline <code>onclick</code> event handler using <code>.removeAttr()</code> doesn't achieve the desired effect in Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8. To avoid potential problems, use <code>.prop()</code> instead:</p>

    <p>Here, the <code>myClass</code> and <code>noClass</code> classes are removed from all paragraphs, while <code>yourClass</code> is added.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.removeData()</code> method allows us to remove values that were previously set using <code>.data()</code>. When called with the name of a key, <code>.removeData()</code> deletes that particular value. When called with no arguments, <code>.removeData()</code> removes all values.</p>
    <p>
      Note that <code>.removeData()</code> will only remove data from jQuery's internal <code>.data()</code> cache, and any corresponding <code>data-</code> attributes on the element will not be removed. A later call to <code>data()</code>
      will therefore re-retrieve the value from the <code>data-</code> attribute. To prevent this, use <code>.removeAttr()</code> alongside <code>.removeData()</code> to remove the <code>data-</code> attribute as well. Prior to jQuery 1.4.3,
      as <code>data()</code> did not use <code>data-</code> attributes, this was not an issue.
    </p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.7</strong>, when called with an array of keys or a string of space-separated keys, <code>.removeData()</code> deletes the value of each key in that array or string.</p>

    <p>The <code>.removeProp()</code> method removes properties set by the <code><a href="/prop/">.prop()</a></code> method.</p>
    <p>With some built-in properties of a DOM element or <code>window</code> object, browsers may generate an error if an attempt is made to remove the property. jQuery first assigns the value <code>undefined</code> to the property and ignores any error the browser generates. In general, it is only necessary to remove custom properties that have been set on an object, and not built-in (native) properties.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not use this method to remove native properties such as checked, disabled, or selected. This will remove the property completely and, once removed, cannot be added again to element. Use <code><a href="/prop/">.prop()</a></code> to set these properties to <code>false</code> instead.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			In Internet Explorer prior to version 9, using <code><a href="/prop/">.prop()</a></code> to set a DOM element property to anything other than a simple primitive value (number, string, or boolean) can cause memory leaks if the property is not removed (using <a href="/removeProp/"><code>.removeProp()</code></a>) before the DOM element is removed from the document. To safely set values on DOM objects without memory leaks, use <a href="/data/"><code>.data()</code></a>.

    <p>This example demonstrates that the selected element replaces the target by being moved from its old location, not by being cloned.</p>
    <p>The <code>.replaceWith()</code> method, like most jQuery methods, returns the jQuery object so that other methods can be chained onto it.

  <note>
			The <code>.replaceWith()</code> method removes all data and event handlers associated with the removed nodes.

  <note>
			Prior to jQuery 1.9, <code>.replaceWith()</code> would attempt to add or change nodes in the current jQuery set if the first node in the set was not connected to a document, and in those cases return a new jQuery set rather than the original set. The method might or might not have returned a new result depending on the number or connectedness of its arguments! As of jQuery 1.9, <code>.after()</code>, <code>.before()</code>, and <code>.replaceWith()</code> always return the original unmodified set. Attempting to use these methods on a node without a parent has no effect���that is, neither the set nor the nodes it contains are changed.

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "scroll", handler )</code> in the first and second variations, and <code>.trigger( "scroll" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>scroll</code> event is sent to an element when the user scrolls to a different place in the element. It applies to <code>window</code> objects, but also to scrollable frames and elements with the <code>overflow </code>CSS property set to <code>scroll</code> (or <code>auto</code> when the element's explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents).</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="target" style="overflow: scroll; width: 200px; height: 100px;"&gt;
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit,
  sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
  aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation

  sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui
  officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="log"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>The style definition is present to make the target element small enough to be scrollable:</p>
    <p class="image">
      <img src="/resources/0042_05_11.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The <code>scroll</code> event handler can be bound to this element:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).scroll(function() {
  $( "#log" ).append( "&lt;div&gt;Handler for .scroll() called.&lt;/div&gt;" );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the user scrolls the text up or down, one or more messages are appended to <code>&lt;div id="log"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Handler for .scroll() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>To trigger the event manually, apply <code>.scroll()</code> without an argument:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).scroll();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also append the message.</p>
    <p>A <code>scroll</code> event is sent whenever the element's scroll position changes, regardless of the cause. A mouse click or drag on the scroll bar, dragging inside the element, pressing the arrow keys, or using the mouse's scroll wheel could cause this event.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>

It may be removed without notice in a future version. The property was never a reliable indicator of the selector that could be used to obtain the set of elements currently contained in the jQuery set where it was a property, since subsequent traversal methods may have changed the set. Plugins that need to use a selector string within their plugin can require it as a parameter of the method. For example, a "foo" plugin could be written as <code>$.fn.foo = function( selector, options ) { /* plugin code goes here */ };</code>, and the person using the plugin would write <code>$( "div.bar" ).foo( "div.bar", {dog: "bark"} );</code> with the <code>"div.bar"</code> selector repeated as the first argument of <code>.foo()</code>.</p>

    <p>It is typically easier, however, to select the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> itself for serialization:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "form" ).on( "submit", function( event ) {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log( $( this ).serialize() );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this case, jQuery serializes the successful controls within the form. Only <code>form</code> elements are examined for inputs they contain, in all other cases the input elements to be serialized should be part of the set passed to the <code>.serialize()</code> method. Selecting both the form and its children in a set will cause duplicates in the serialized string.</p>
    <p>Note: Only <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2">"successful controls"</a> are serialized to the string. No submit button value is serialized since the form was not submitted using a button. For a form element's value to be included in the serialized string, the element must have a <code>name</code> attribute. Values from checkboxes and radio buttons (<code>input</code>s of type "radio" or "checkbox") are included only if they are checked. Data from file select elements is not serialized.</p>

  <desc>Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.serializeArray()</code> method creates a JavaScript array of objects, ready to be encoded as a JSON string. It operates on a jQuery collection of <code>form</code>s and/or form controls. The controls can be of several types:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="a" value="1" id="a"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;input type="text" name="b" value="2" id="b"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;input type="hidden" name="c" value="3" id="c"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;textarea name="d" rows="8" cols="40"&gt;4&lt;/textarea&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;select name="e"&gt;
    &lt;option value="5" selected="selected"&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="6"&gt;6&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option value="7"&gt;7&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;/select&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input type="checkbox" name="f" value="8" id="f"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" name="g" value="Submit" id="g"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The <code>.serializeArray()</code> method uses the standard W3C rules for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2">successful controls</a> to determine which elements it should include; in particular the element cannot be disabled and must contain a <code>name</code> attribute. No submit button value is serialized since the form was not submitted using a button. Data from file select elements is not serialized.</p>
    <p>This method can act on a jQuery object that has selected individual form controls, such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>. However, it is typically easier to select the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element itself for serialization:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "form" ).submit(function( event ) {
  console.log( $( this ).serializeArray() );
  event.preventDefault();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This produces the following data structure (provided that the browser supports <code>console.log</code>):</p>
    <pre><code>
[
  {
    name: "a",
    value: "1"
  },
  {
    name: "b",
    value: "2"

    <p>With no parameters, the <code>.show()</code> method is the simplest way to display an element:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".target" ).show();
    </code></pre>
    <p>The matched elements will be revealed immediately, with no animation. This is roughly equivalent to calling <code>.css( "display", "block")</code>, except that the <code>display</code> property is restored to whatever it was initially. If an element has a <code>display</code> value of <code>inline</code>, then is hidden and shown, it will once again be displayed <code>inline</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong> If using !important in your styles, such as
    <code>display: none !important</code>,
    it is necessary to override the style using <code>.css( "display", "block !important")</code> should you wish for <code>.show()</code> to function correctly.</p>
    <p>When a duration, a plain object, or a "complete" function is provided, <code>.show()</code> becomes an animation method. The <code>.show()</code> method animates the width, height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4.3, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
With the element initially hidden, we can show it slowly:
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).show( "slow", function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p class="image four-across">
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_01.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_02.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_03.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_04.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.show()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

  <desc>Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.siblings()</code> method allows us to search through the siblings of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements.</p>
    <p>The method optionally accepts a selector expression of the same type that we can pass to the <code>$()</code> function. If the selector is supplied, the elements will be filtered by testing whether they match it.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class="third-item"&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>If we begin at the third item, we can find its siblings:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li.third-item" ).siblings().css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background behind items 1, 2, 4, and 5. Since we do not supply a selector expression, all of the siblings are part of the object. If we had supplied one, only the matching items among these four would be included.</p>
    <p>The original element is not included among the siblings, which is important to remember when we wish to find all elements at a particular level of the DOM tree.</p>

    <p>The <code>.size()</code> method is functionally equivalent to the <code><a href="/length/">.length</a></code> property; however, <strong>the <code>.length</code> property is preferred</strong> because it does not have the overhead of a function call.</p>
    <p>Given a simple unordered list on the page:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>Both <code>.size()</code> and <code>.length</code> identify the number of items:</p>
    <pre><code>
alert( "Size: " + $( "li" ).size() );
alert( "Size: " + $( "li" ).length );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This results in two alerts:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>Size: 2</samp>
    </p>
    <p>
      <samp>Size: 2</samp>

    <argument name="start" type="Integer">
      <desc>An integer indicating the 0-based position at which the elements begin to be selected. If negative, it indicates an offset from the end of the set.</desc>
    </argument>
    <argument name="end" optional="true" type="Integer">
      <desc>An integer indicating the 0-based position at which the elements stop being selected. If negative, it indicates an offset from the end of the set. If omitted, the range continues until the end of the set.</desc>
    </argument>
  </signature>
  <desc>Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the <code>.slice()</code> method constructs a new jQuery object containing a subset of the elements specified by the <code>start</code> and, optionally, <code>end</code> argument. The supplied <code>start</code> index identifies the position of one of the elements in the set; if <code>end</code> is omitted, all elements after this one will be included in the result.</p>
    <p>Consider a page with a simple list on it:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 4&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;list item 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can apply this method to the set of list items:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).slice( 2 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The result of this call is a red background for items 3, 4, and 5. Note that the supplied index is zero-based, and refers to the position of elements within the jQuery object, not within the DOM tree.</p>
    <p>The end parameter allows us to limit the selected range even further. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).slice( 2, 4 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now only items 3 and 4 are selected. The index is once again zero-based; the range extends up to but not including the specified index.</p>
    <h4>Negative Indices</h4>
    <p>The jQuery <code>.slice()</code> method is patterned after the JavaScript .slice() method for arrays. One of the features that it mimics is the ability for negative numbers to be passed as either the <code>start</code> or <code>end</code> parameter. If a negative number is provided, this indicates a position starting from the end of the set, rather than the beginning. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "li" ).slice( -2, -1 ).css( "background-color", "red" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>This time only list item 4 is turned red, since it is the only item in the range between two from the end (<code>-2</code>) and one from the end (<code>-1</code>).</p>

    <p>The <code>.slideDown()</code> method animates the height of the matched elements. This causes lower parts of the page to slide down, making way for the revealed items.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied, or if the <code>duration</code> parameter is omitted, the default duration of  <code>400</code> milliseconds is used.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>With the element initially hidden, we can show it slowly:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).slideDown( "slow", function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });
});
    </code></pre>

    <h4 id="easing">Easing</h4>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4.3</strong>, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="callback-function">Callback Function</h4>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code><a href="/promise/">.promise()</a></code> method can be used in conjunction with the <code><a href="/deferred.done/">deferred.done()</a></code> method to execute a single callback for the animation as a whole when <em>all</em> matching elements have completed their animations ( See the <a href="/promise/#example-1">example for .promise()</a> ).  </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.slideDown()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.
		</note>
  <note>
			If <code>.slideDown()</code> is called on an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) and its <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements have position (relative, absolute, or fixed), the effect may not work properly in IE6 through at least IE9 unless the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> has "layout." To remedy the problem, add the <code>position: relative;</code> and <code>zoom: 1;</code> CSS declarations to the <code>ul</code>.

    <h4 id="easing">Easing</h4>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4.3</strong>, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="callback-function">Callback Function</h4>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.6</strong>, the <code><a href="/promise/">.promise()</a></code> method can be used in conjunction with the <code><a href="/deferred.done/">deferred.done()</a></code> method to execute a single callback for the animation as a whole when <em>all</em> matching elements have completed their animations ( See the <a href="/promise/#example-1">example for .promise()</a> ).  </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.slideToggle()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.
		</note>
  <note>
			If <code>.slideDown()</code> is called on an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>) and its <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements have position (relative, absolute, or fixed), the effect may not work properly in IE6 through at least IE9 unless the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> has "layout." To remedy the problem, add the <code>position: relative;</code> and <code>zoom: 1;</code> CSS declarations to the <code>ul</code>.

    <p>The <code>.slideUp()</code> method animates the height of the matched elements. This causes lower parts of the page to slide up, appearing to conceal the items. Once the height reaches 0 (or, if set, to whatever the CSS min-height property is), the <code>display</code> style property is set to <code>none</code> to ensure that the element no longer affects the layout of the page.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively. If any other string is supplied, or if the <code>duration</code> parameter is omitted, the default duration of  <code>400</code> milliseconds is used.</p>

    <p>When <code>.stop()</code> is called on an element, the currently-running animation (if any) is immediately stopped. If, for instance, an element is being hidden with <code>.slideUp()</code> when <code>.stop()</code> is called, the element will now still be displayed, but will be a fraction of its previous height. Callback functions are not called.</p>
    <p>If more than one animation method is called on the same element, the later animations are placed in the effects queue for the element. These animations will not begin until the first one completes. When <code>.stop()</code> is called, the next animation in the queue begins immediately. If the <code>clearQueue</code> parameter is provided with a value of <code>true</code>, then the rest of the animations in the queue are removed and never run.</p>
    <p>If the <code>jumpToEnd</code> argument is provided with a value of <code>true</code>, the current animation stops, but the element is immediately given its target values for each CSS property. In our above <code>.slideUp()</code> example, the element would be immediately hidden. The callback function is then immediately called, if provided.</p>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.7</strong>, if the first argument is provided as a string, only the animations in the queue represented by that string will be stopped.</p>
    <p>The usefulness of the <code>.stop()</code> method is evident when we need to animate an element on <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="hoverme"&gt;
  Hover me
  &lt;img id="hoverme" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can create a nice fade effect without the common problem of multiple queued animations by adding <code>.stop(true, true)</code> to the chain:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#hoverme-stop-2" ).hover(function() {
  $( this ).find( "img" ).stop( true, true ).fadeOut();
}, function() {
  $( this ).find( "img" ).stop( true, true ).fadeIn();
});
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Toggling Animations</h2>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.7,</strong> stopping a toggled animation prematurely with <code>.stop()</code> will trigger jQuery's internal effects tracking. In previous versions, calling the <code>.stop()</code> method before a toggled animation was completed would cause the animation to lose track of its state (if jumpToEnd was false). Any subsequent animations would start at a new "half-way" state, sometimes resulting in the element disappearing. To observe the new behavior, see the final example below.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Animations may be stopped globally by setting the property <code>$.fx.off</code> to <code>true</code>. When this is done, all animation methods will immediately set elements to their final state when called, rather than displaying an effect.</p>
    </div>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Click the Go button once to start the animation, then click the STOP button to stop it where it's currently positioned.  Another option is to click several buttons to queue them up and see that stop just kills the currently playing one.</desc>
    <code>

$( "#go" ).click(function() {
  $( ".block" ).animate({ left: "+=100px" }, 2000 );
});

// Stop animation when button is clicked

// Start animation in the opposite direction

  <desc>Selects all elements of type submit.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>:submit</code> selector typically applies to button or input elements. Note that some browsers treat <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element as <code>type="submit"</code> implicitly while others (such as Internet Explorer) do not. To ensure that markup works consistently across all browsers and guarantee that it is possible to consistently select buttons that will submit a form, always specify a <code>type</code> property.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:submit</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:submit</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. For better performance in modern browsers, use <code>input[type="submit"], button[type="submit"]</code> instead.

    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "submit", handler )</code> in the first variation, and <code>.trigger( "submit" )</code> in the third.</p>
    <p>The <code>submit</code> event is sent to an element when the user is attempting to submit a form. It can only be attached to <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements. Forms can be submitted either by clicking an explicit <code>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;input type="image"&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;button type="submit"&gt;</code>, or by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> when certain form elements have focus.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>Depending on the browser, the Enter key may only cause a form submission if the form has exactly one text field, or only when there is a submit button present. The interface should not rely on a particular behavior for this key unless the issue is forced by observing the keypress event for presses of the Enter key.</p>
    </div>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;form id="target" action="destination.html"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" value="Hello there"&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Go"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id="other"&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>The event handler can be bound to the form:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).submit(function( event ) {
  alert( "Handler for .submit() called." );
  event.preventDefault();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Now when the form is submitted, the message is alerted. This happens prior to the actual submission, so we can cancel the submit action by calling <code>.preventDefault()</code> on the event object or by returning <code>false</code> from our handler. We can trigger the event manually when another element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#other" ).click(function() {
  $( "#target" ).submit();
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, clicks on <samp>Trigger the handler</samp> will also display the message. In addition, the default <code>submit</code> action on the form will be fired, so the form will be submitted.</p>
    <p>The JavaScript <code>submit</code> event does not bubble in Internet Explorer. However, scripts that rely on event delegation with the <code>submit</code> event will work consistently across browsers as of jQuery 1.4, which has normalized the event's behavior. </p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Forms and their child elements should not use input names or ids that conflict with properties of a form, such as <code>submit</code>, <code>length</code>, or <code>method</code>. Name conflicts can cause confusing failures. For a complete list of rules and to check your markup for these problems, see <a href="http://kangax.github.com/domlint/">DOMLint</a>.

  <longdesc>
    <p><code>$( ":text" )</code> allows us to select all <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> elements. As with other pseudo-class selectors (those that begin with a ":") it is recommended to precede it with a tag name or some other selector; otherwise, the universal selector ( "*" ) is implied. In other words, the bare <code>$( ":text" )</code> is equivalent to <code>$( "*:text" )</code>, so <code>$( "input:text" )</code> should be used instead. </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> As of jQuery 1.5.2, <code>:text</code> selects <code>input</code> elements that have no specified <code>type</code> attribute (in which case <code>type="text"</code> is implied).  </p>
    <p>This difference in behavior between <code>$( ":text" )</code> and <code>$( "[type=text]" )</code>, can be seen below:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "&lt;input&gt;" ).is( "[type=text]" ); // false
$( "&lt;input&gt;" ).is( ":text" ); // true
    </code></pre>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:text</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:text</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. For better performance in modern browsers, use <code>[type="text"]</code> instead.

    <longdesc>
      <p>Unlike the <code>.html()</code> method, <code>.text()</code> can be used in both XML and HTML documents. The result of the <code>.text()</code> method is a string containing the combined text of all matched elements. (Due to variations in the HTML parsers in different browsers, the text returned may vary in newlines and other white space.) Consider the following HTML:</p>
      <pre><code>
&lt;div class="demo-container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="demo-box"&gt;Demonstration Box&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;list item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;list &lt;strong&gt;item&lt;/strong&gt; 2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>The code <code>$( "div.demo-container" ).text()</code> would produce the following result:</p>
      <p>
        <code>Demonstration Box list item 1 list item 2</code>
      </p>
      <p>The <code>.text()</code> method cannot be used on form inputs or scripts.  To set or get the text value of <code>input</code> or <code>textarea</code> elements, use the <a href="/val/"><code>.val()</code></a> method. To get the value of a script element, use the <a href="/html/"><code>.html()</code></a> method.</p>
      <p>As of jQuery 1.4, the <code>.text()</code> method returns the value of text and CDATA nodes as well as element nodes.</p>

      <p>Note: This method signature was deprecated in jQuery 1.8 and removed in jQuery 1.9. jQuery also provides an animation method named <a href="/toggle/">.toggle()</a> that toggles the visibility of elements. Whether the animation or the event method is fired depends on the set of arguments passed.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The <code>.toggle()</code> method binds a handler for the <code>click</code> event, so the rules outlined for the triggering of <code>click</code> apply here as well.</p>
    <p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="target"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>Event handlers can then be bound to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#target" ).toggle(function() {
  alert( "First handler for .toggle() called." );
}, function() {
  alert( "Second handler for .toggle() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>As the element is clicked repeatedly, the messages alternate:</p>
    <p>
      <samp>First handler for .toggle() called.</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>Second handler for .toggle() called.</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>First handler for .toggle() called.</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>Second handler for .toggle() called.</samp>
      <br/>
      <samp>First handler for .toggle() called.</samp>
    </p>
    <p>If more than two handlers are provided, <code>.toggle()</code> will cycle among all of them. For example, if there are three handlers, then the first handler will be called on the first click, the fourth click, the seventh click, and so on.</p>
    <p>The <code>.toggle()</code> method is provided for convenience. It is relatively straightforward to implement the same behavior by hand, and this can be necessary if the assumptions built into <code>.toggle()</code> prove limiting. For example, <code>.toggle()</code> is not guaranteed to work correctly if applied twice to the same element. Since <code>.toggle()</code> internally uses a <code>click</code> handler to do its work, we must unbind <code>click</code> to remove a behavior attached with <code>.toggle()</code>, so other <code>click</code> handlers can be caught in the crossfire. The implementation also calls <code>.preventDefault()</code> on the event, so links will not be followed and buttons will not be clicked if <code>.toggle()</code> has been called on the element.</p>

    <div class="warning">
      <p>Note: The event handling suite also has a method named <a href="/toggle-event/">.toggle()</a>. Which one is fired depends on the set of arguments passed.</p>
    </div>
    <p>With no parameters, the <code>.toggle()</code> method simply toggles the visibility of elements:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".target" ).toggle();
    </code></pre>
    <p>The matched elements will be revealed or hidden immediately, with no animation, by changing the CSS <code>display</code> property. If the element is initially displayed, it will be hidden; if hidden, it will be shown. The <code>display</code> property is saved and restored as needed. If an element has a <code>display</code> value of <code>inline</code>, then is hidden and shown, it will once again be displayed <code>inline</code>.</p>
    <p>When a duration, a plain object, or a <em>single</em> "complete" function is provided, <code>.toggle()</code> becomes an animation method. The <code>.toggle()</code> method animates the width, height, and opacity of the matched elements simultaneously. When these properties reach 0 after a hiding animation, the <code>display</code> style property is set to <code>none</code> to ensure that the element no longer affects the layout of the page.</p>
    <p>Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones. The strings <code>'fast'</code> and <code>'slow'</code> can be supplied to indicate durations of <code>200</code> and <code>600</code> milliseconds, respectively.</p>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.4.3, an optional string naming an easing function may be used. Easing functions specify the speed at which the animation progresses at different points within the animation. The only easing implementations in the jQuery library are the default, called <code>swing</code>, and one that progresses at a constant pace, called <code>linear</code>. More easing functions are available with the use of plug-ins, most notably the <a href="http://jqueryui.com">jQuery UI suite</a>.</p>
    <p>If supplied, the callback is fired once the animation is complete. This can be useful for stringing different animations together in sequence. The callback is not sent any arguments, but <code>this</code> is set to the DOM element being animated. If multiple elements are animated, it is important to note that the callback is executed once per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole.</p>
    <p>We can animate any element, such as a simple image:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div id="clickme"&gt;
  Click here
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img id="book" src="book.png" alt="" width="100" height="123"&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>We will cause <code>.toggle()</code> to be called when another element is clicked:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#clickme" ).click(function() {
  $( "#book" ).toggle( "slow", function() {
    // Animation complete.
  });
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>With the element initially shown, we can hide it slowly with the first click:
    </p>
    <p class="image four-across">
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_09.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_10.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_11.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_12.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>A second click will show the element once again:</p>
    <p class="image four-across">
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_13.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_14.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_15.png" alt=""/>
      <img src="/resources/0042_06_16.png" alt=""/>
    </p>
    <p>The second version of the method accepts a Boolean parameter. If this parameter is <code>true</code>, then the matched elements are shown; if <code>false</code>, the elements are hidden. In essence, the statement:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).toggle( showOrHide );
    </code></pre>
    <p>is equivalent to:</p>
    <pre><code>
if ( showOrHide === true ) {
  $( "#foo" ).show();
} else if ( showOrHide === false ) {
  $( "#foo" ).hide();
}
    </code></pre>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			All jQuery effects, including <code>.toggle()</code>, can be turned off globally by setting <code>jQuery.fx.off = true</code>, which effectively sets the duration to 0. For more information, see <a href="/jquery.fx.off/">jQuery.fx.off</a>.

  <longdesc>
    <p>This method takes one or more class names as its parameter. In the first version, if an element in the matched set of elements already has the class, then it is removed; if an element does not have the class, then it is added. For example, we can apply <code>.toggleClass()</code> to a simple <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>: </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="tumble"&gt;Some text.&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The first time we apply <code>$( "div.tumble" ).toggleClass( "bounce" )</code>, we get the following:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="tumble bounce"&gt;Some text.&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The second time we apply <code>$( "div.tumble" ).toggleClass( "bounce" )</code>, the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> class is returned to the single <code>tumble</code> value:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;div class="tumble"&gt;Some text.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Applying <code>.toggleClass( "bounce spin" )</code> to the same <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> alternates between <code>&lt;div class="tumble bounce spin"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div class="tumble"&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>The second version of <code>.toggleClass()</code> uses the second parameter for determining whether the class should be added or removed. If this parameter's value is <code>true</code>, then the class is added; if <code>false</code>, the class is removed. In essence, the statement:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).toggleClass( className, addOrRemove );
    </code></pre>
    <p>is equivalent to:</p>
    <pre><code>
if ( addOrRemove ) {
  $( "#foo" ).addClass( className );
} else {
  $( "#foo" ).removeClass( className );
}
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>As of jQuery 1.4</strong>, if no arguments are passed to <code>.toggleClass()</code>, all class names on the element the first time <code>.toggleClass()</code> is called will be toggled. Also as of jQuery 1.4, the class name to be toggled can be determined by passing in a function.</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "div.foo" ).toggleClass(function() {
  if ( $( this ).parent().is( ".bar" ) ) {
    return "happy";
  } else {
    return "sad";
  }
});
</code></pre>
    <p>This example will toggle the <code>happy</code> class for <code>&lt;div class="foo"&gt;</code> elements if their parent element has a class of <code>bar</code>; otherwise, it will toggle the <code>sad</code> class.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>Any event handlers attached with <code>.on()</code> or one of its shortcut methods are triggered when the corresponding event occurs. They can be fired manually, however, with the <code>.trigger()</code> method. A call to <code>.trigger()</code> executes the handlers in the same order they would be if the event were triggered naturally by the user:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).on( "click", function() {
  alert( $( this ).text() );
});
$( "#foo" ).trigger( "click" );
   </code></pre>
    <p>As of jQuery 1.3, <code>.trigger()</code>ed events bubble up the DOM tree; an event handler can stop the bubbling by returning <code>false</code> from the handler or calling the <a href="/event.stopPropagation/"><code>.stopPropagation()</code></a> method on the event object passed into the event. Although <code>.trigger()</code> simulates an event activation, complete with a synthesized event object, it does not perfectly replicate a naturally-occurring event.</p>
    <p>To trigger handlers bound via jQuery without also triggering the native event, use <a href="/triggerHandler/"><code>.triggerHandler()</code></a> instead. </p>
    <p>When we define a custom event type using the <code>.on()</code> method, the second argument to <code>.trigger()</code> can become useful. For example, suppose we have bound a handler for the <code>custom</code> event to our element instead of the built-in <code>click</code> event as we did above:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).on( "custom", function( event, param1, param2 ) {
  alert( param1 + "\n" + param2 );
});
$( "#foo").trigger( "custom", [ "Custom", "Event" ] );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The event object is always passed as the first parameter to an event handler. An array of arguments can also be passed to the .trigger() call, and these parameters will be passed along to the handler as well following the event object. As of jQuery 1.6.2, single string or numeric argument can be passed without being wrapped in an array.</p>
    <p>Note the difference between the extra parameters passed here and the <code>eventData</code> parameter to the <a href="/on/">.on()</a> method. Both are mechanisms for passing information to an event handler, but the <code>extraParameters</code> argument to <code>.trigger()</code> allows information to be determined at the time the event is triggered, while the <code>eventData</code> argument to <code>.on()</code> requires the information to be already computed at the time the handler is bound.</p>
    <p>The <code>.trigger()</code> method can be used on jQuery collections that wrap plain JavaScript objects similar to a pub/sub mechanism; any event handlers bound to the object will be called when the event is triggered. </p>
    <div class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong> For both plain objects and DOM objects other than <code>window</code>, if a triggered event name matches the name of a property on the object, jQuery will attempt to invoke the property as a method if no event handler calls <code>event.preventDefault()</code>. If this behavior is not desired, use <code>.triggerHandler()</code> instead.</div>

      <li>The <code>.triggerHandler()</code> method does not cause the default behavior of an event to occur (such as a form submission).</li>
      <li>While <code>.trigger()</code> will operate on all elements matched by the jQuery object, <code>.triggerHandler()</code> only affects the first matched element.</li>
      <li>Events triggered with <code>.triggerHandler()</code> do not bubble up the DOM hierarchy; if they are not handled by the target element directly, they do nothing.</li>
      <li>Instead of returning the jQuery object (to allow chaining), <code>.triggerHandler()</code> returns whatever value was returned by the last handler it caused to be executed. If no handlers are triggered, it returns <code>undefined</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on this method, see the discussion for <code><a href="/trigger/">.trigger()</a></code>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>If you called .triggerHandler() on a focus event - the browser's default focus action would not be triggered, only the event handlers bound to the focus event.</desc>
    <code>

  <longdesc>
    <p>Event handlers attached with <code>.bind()</code> can be removed with <code>.unbind()</code>. (As of jQuery 1.7, the <a href="/on/"><code>.on()</code></a> and <a href="/off/"><code>.off()</code></a> methods are preferred to attach and remove event handlers on elements.) In the simplest case, with no arguments, <code>.unbind()</code> removes all handlers attached to the elements:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).unbind();
    </code></pre>
    <p>This version removes the handlers regardless of type. To be more precise, we can pass an event type:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo").unbind( "click" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>By specifying the <code>click</code> event type, only handlers for that event type will be unbound. This approach can still have negative ramifications if other scripts might be attaching behaviors to the same element, however. Robust and extensible applications typically demand the two-argument version for this reason:</p>
    <pre><code>
var handler = function() {
  alert( "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." );
};
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", handler );
$( "#foo" ).unbind( "click", handler );
    </code></pre>
    <p>By naming the handler, we can be assured that no other functions are accidentally removed. Note that the following will <em>not</em> work:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", function() {
  alert( "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." );
});

// Will NOT work
$( "#foo" ).unbind( "click", function() {
  alert( "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>Even though the two functions are identical in content, they are created separately and so JavaScript is free to keep them as distinct function objects. To unbind a particular handler, we need a reference to that function and not a different one that happens to do the same thing.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using a proxied function to unbind an event on an element will unbind all proxied functions on that element, as the same proxy function is used for all proxied events. To allow unbinding a specific event, use unique class names on the event (e.g. <code>click.proxy1</code>, <code>click.proxy2</code>) when attaching them.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Using Namespaces</h4>
    <p>Instead of maintaining references to handlers in order to unbind them, we can namespace the events and use this capability to narrow the scope of our unbinding actions. As shown in the discussion for the <code>.bind()</code> method, namespaces are defined by using a period (<code>.</code>) character when binding a handler:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click.myEvents", handler );
    </code></pre>
    <p>When a handler is bound in this fashion, we can still unbind it the normal way:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).unbind( "click" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>However, if we want to avoid affecting other handlers, we can be more specific:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).unbind( "click.myEvents" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>We can also unbind all of the handlers in a namespace, regardless of event type:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( "#foo" ).unbind( ".myEvents" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>It is particularly useful to attach namespaces to event bindings when we are developing plug-ins or otherwise writing code that may interact with other event-handling code in the future.</p>
    <h4>Using the Event Object</h4>
    <p>The third form of the <code>.unbind()</code> method is used when we wish to unbind a handler from within itself. For example, suppose we wish to trigger an event handler only three times:</p>
    <pre><code>
var timesClicked = 0;
$( "#foo" ).bind( "click", function( event ) {
  alert( "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." );
  timesClicked++;
  if ( timesClicked &gt;= 3 ) {
    $( this ).unbind( event );
  }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>The handler in this case must take a parameter, so that we can capture the event object and use it to unbind the handler after the third click. The event object contains the context necessary for <code>.unbind()</code> to know which handler to remove.
This example is also an illustration of a closure. Since the handler refers to the <code>timesClicked</code> variable, which is defined outside the function, incrementing the variable has an effect even between invocations of the handler.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>This method is a shortcut for <code>.on( "unload", handler )</code>.</p>
    <p>The <code>unload</code> event is sent to the <code>window</code> element when the user navigates away from the page. This could mean one of many things. The user could have clicked on a link to leave the page, or typed in a new URL in the address bar. The forward and back buttons will trigger the event. Closing the browser window will cause the event to be triggered. Even a page reload will first create an <code>unload</code> event.</p>
    <div class="warning">
      <p>The exact handling of the <code>unload</code> event has varied from version to version of browsers. For example, some versions of Firefox trigger the event when a link is followed, but not when the window is closed. In practical usage, behavior should be tested on all supported browsers, and contrasted with the proprietary <code>beforeunload</code> event.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Any <code>unload</code> event handler should be bound to the <code>window</code> object:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( window ).unload(function() {
  alert( "Handler for .unload() called." );
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>After this code executes, the alert will be displayed whenever the browser leaves the current page.
It is not possible to cancel the <code>unload</code> event with <code>.preventDefault()</code>. This event is available so that scripts can perform cleanup when the user leaves the page.

    <desc>Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements.</desc>

      <p>The <code>.val()</code> method is primarily used to get the values of form elements such as <code>input</code>, <code>select</code> and <code>textarea</code>. In the case of <code>select</code> elements, it returns <code>null</code> when no option is selected and an array containing the value of each selected option when there is at least one and it is possible to select more because the <code>multiple</code> attribute is present.</p>
      <p>For selects and checkboxes, you can also use the <a href="/selected/">:selected</a> and <a href="/checked/">:checked</a> selectors to get at values, for example:</p>
      <pre><code>

$( "select.foo option:selected").val();

// Get the value from a dropdown select even easier
$( "select.foo" ).val();

// Get the value from a set of radio buttons
$( "input:radio[name=bar]:checked" ).val();
      </code></pre>
      <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Note: </strong> At present, using <code>.val()</code> on textarea elements strips carriage return characters from the browser-reported value. When this value is sent to the server via XHR however, carriage returns are preserved (or added by browsers which do not include them in the raw value). A workaround for this issue can be achieved using a valHook as follows:</p>
      </div>
      <pre><code>
$.valHooks.textarea = {

  <longdesc>
    <p>Elements are considered visible if they consume space in the document. Visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero.</p>
    <p>Elements with <code>visibility: hidden</code> or <code>opacity: 0</code> are considered visible, since they still consume space in the layout.</p>
    <p>Elements that are not in a document are considered hidden; jQuery does not have a way to know if they will be visible when appended to a document since it depends on the applicable styles.</p>
    <p>All <code>option</code> elements are considered hidden, regardless of their <code>selected</code> state.</p>
    <p>During animations that hide an element, the element is considered visible until the end of the animation. During animations to show an element, the element is considered visible at the start at the animation.</p>
    <p>How <code>:visible</code> is calculated was changed in jQuery 1.3.2. The <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2009/02/20/jquery-1-3-2-released/">release notes</a> outline the changes in more detail.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <note>
			Because <code>:visible</code> is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using <code>:visible</code> cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM <code>querySelectorAll()</code> method. To achieve the best performance when using <code>:visible</code> to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use <a href="/filter/"><code>.filter(":visible")</code></a>.

    <desc>Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements.</desc>
    <longdesc>
      <p>The difference between <code>.css(width)</code> and <code>.width()</code> is that the latter returns a unit-less pixel value (for example, <code>400</code>) while the former returns a value with units intact (for example, <code>400px</code>). The <code>.width()</code> method is recommended when an element's width needs to be used in a mathematical calculation.</p>
      <p class="image">
        <img src="/resources/0042_04_04.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>This method is also able to find the width of the window and document.</p>
      <pre><code>
// Returns width of browser viewport
$( window ).width();

// Returns width of HTML document
$( document ).width();
      </code></pre>
      <p>Note that <code>.width()</code> will always return the content width, regardless of the value of the CSS <code>box-sizing</code> property. As of jQuery 1.8, this may require retrieving the CSS width plus <code>box-sizing</code> property and then subtracting any potential border and padding on each element when the element has <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>. To avoid this penalty, use <code>.css( "width" )</code> rather than <code>.width()</code>.</p>
      <div class="warning">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although <code>style</code> and <code>script</code> tags will report a value for <code>.width()</code> or <code>height()</code> when absolutely positioned and given <code>display:block</code>, it is strongly discouraged to call those methods on these tags. In addition to being a bad practice, the results may also prove unreliable.</p>
      </div>
    </longdesc>
  	<note>
			The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including <code>.width()</code>, may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer. Also, dimensions may be incorrect when the page is zoomed by the user; browsers do not expose an API to detect this condition.
		</note>
    <note>
			The value reported by <code>.width()</code> is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element's parent is hidden. To get an accurate value, you should show the parent first, before using <code>.width()</code>.

      <p>When calling <code>.width("value")</code>, the value can be either a string (number and unit) or a number. If only a number is provided for the value, jQuery assumes a pixel unit.

Note that in modern browsers, the CSS width property does not include padding, border, or margin, unless the <code>box-sizing</code> CSS property is used.</p>

  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.wrap()</code> function can take any string or object that could be passed to the <code>$()</code> factory function to specify a DOM structure. This structure may be nested several levels deep, but should contain only one inmost element. A copy of this structure will be wrapped around each of the elements in the set of matched elements. This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes.</p>
    <p>Consider the following HTML:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>Using <code>.wrap()</code>, we can insert an HTML structure around the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements like so:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).wrap( "&lt;div class='new'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" );
    </code></pre>
    <p>The new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is created on the fly and added to the DOM. The result is a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> wrapped around each matched element:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="new"&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="new"&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The second version of this method allows us to instead specify a callback function. This callback function will be called once for every matched element; it should return a DOM element, jQuery object, or HTML snippet in which to wrap the corresponding element. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).wrap(function() {
  return "&lt;div class='" + $( this ).text() + "'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This will cause each <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to have a class corresponding to the text it wraps:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="Hello"&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="Goodbye"&gt;
    &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>Using <code>.wrapInner()</code>, we can insert an HTML structure around the content of each inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements like so:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).wrapInner( "&lt;div class='new'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;");
    </code></pre>
    <p>The new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is created on the fly and added to the DOM. The result is a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> wrapped around the content of each matched element:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="new"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="new"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p>The second version of this method allows us to instead specify a callback function. This callback function will be called once for every matched element; it should return a DOM element, jQuery object, or HTML snippet in which to wrap the content of the corresponding element. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( ".inner" ).wrapInner(function() {
  return "&lt;div class='" + this.nodeValue + "'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";
});
    </code></pre>
    <p>This will cause each <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to have a class corresponding to the text it wraps:</p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="Hello"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="inner"&gt;
    &lt;div class="Goodbye"&gt;Goodbye&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> When passing a selector string to the <code>.wrapInner()</code> function, the expected input is well formed HTML with correctly closed tags. Examples of valid input include:</p>
    <pre><code>
$( elem ).wrapInner( "&lt;div class='test'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" );
$( elem ).wrapInner( "&lt;div class=\"test\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" );
    </code></pre>
